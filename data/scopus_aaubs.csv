This study posits that this is not a reasonable approach to achieving such a balance. I used a micro-economic model where the explorative and exploitative activities are modeled in accordance with the definitions in March (1991). This model shows that the personal cost to the employee of performing activities was a crucial factor in determining their balancing of resources between exploration and exploitation. However, these personal costs are also the Achilles' heel of such balance calculations because information regarding this type of cost is incomplete and difficult, perhaps even impossible, for the owner or manager to obtain. Based on this and the process and output characteristics of exploratory activities, I argue that it is not appropriate to design a hard, quantitative performance measurement and incentive system to balance resource allocation between explorative and exploitative activities. The study shows that the solution to achieving such a balance must be found outside of the incentive system. Further, I posit that managing R&D departments requires the management to focus on enforcing productive workspaces and norms and not on performance measurement and associated disbursal of rewards/punishments. © 2022 The Author","Exploration and exploitation; Incentives; Innovation; Performance measurement","Economic models; Exploration and exploitation; Incentive; Incentive structure; Incentive systems; Incremental innovation; Innovation; Organisational; Performance measurements; Radical innovation; Economics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ardito, L., Besson, E., Petruzzelli, A.M., Gregori, G.L., The influence of production, IT, and logistics process innovations on ambidexterity performance (2018) Business Process Management Journal, 24 (5), pp. 1271-1284; Ardito, L., Petruzzelli, A.M., Albino, V., The influence of Alliance ambidexterity on innovation performance and the moderating role of firm age (2021) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 68 (2), pp. 370-377; Ardito, L., Petruzzelli, A.M., Dezi, L., Castellano, S., The influence of inbound open innovation on ambidexterity performance: Does it pay to source knowledge from supply chain stakeholders?

Using a multi-method approach combining experimental and field data from online reviews, it was found that intentional (vs. unintentional) failures lead to greater negative word of mouth (nWOM) and patronage reduction. This research extends these findings by demonstrating that intentional failures are less harmful when the failure is reversible (vs. irreversible) and occurs at an employee (vs. firm) level. Further, while either psychological (e.g., apology) or monetary compensation is effective in mitigating the consequences of intentional failures at an employee level, a combined service recovery (psychological and monetary) is the best solution when the failure is at a firm level. Drawing on attribution theory, the article unveils the key role of trust (as opposed to justice) as the mechanism to explain the effects of intentionality on customers’ nWOM and patronage reduction. © The Author(s) 2021.","attribution theory; experiment; intentionality; service failure and recovery; text mining","cost analysis; data mining; experimental study; service quality; travel behavior",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alaei, A.R., Becken, S., Stantic, B., Sentiment Analysis in Tourism: Capitalizing on Big Data (2019) Journal of Travel Research, 58 (2). , (,): 175–91; Ames, D.L., Fiske, S.T., Intentional Harms Are Worse, Even When They’re Not (2013) Psychological Science, 24 (9). , (,): 1755–62; Basso, K., Pizzutti, C., Trust Recovery Following a Double Deviation (2016) Journal of Service Research, 19 (2). , (,): 209-23; Baumeister, R.F., Hutton, D.G., Cairns, K.J., Negative Effects of Praise on Skilled Performance (1990) Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 11 (2). , (,): 131–48; Bavik, A., Bavik, Y.L., Effect of Employee Incivility on Customer Retaliation through Psychological Contract Breach: The Moderating Role of Moral Identity (2015) International Journal of Hospitality Management, 50, pp. 66-76; (2017) United Airlines: Shares drop after passenger dragging video, , https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39563570, accessed December 6, 2020; Beard, J., Williams, A., (2020) How to Get a Refund If Your Flight Was Cancelled Because of Coronavirus, , https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/get-refund-flight-cancelled-coronavirus/, accessed June 6, 2020,,. @MoneyTelegraph; Bejou, D., Edvardsson, B., Rakowski, J.P., A Critical Incident Approach to Examining the Effects of Service Failures on Customer Relationships: The Case of Swedish and US Airlines (1996) Journal of Travel Research, 35 (1), pp. 35-40; Berger, J., Humphreys, A., Ludwig, S., Moe, W.W., Netzer, O., Schweidel, D.A., Uniting the Tribes: Using Text for Marketing Insight (2020) Journal of Marketing, 84 (1), pp. 1-25; Berger, J., Milkman, K.L., What Makes Online Content Viral?

However, hierarchical governance in the form of vertical integration is still preferred in many industries for organizing innovation, and the current literature touches little on the relative performance of different organizational structures (integrated firms vs innovation ecosystem) and the factors that lead firms to choose one over the other. The authors conjecture that structure of technological interdependence is one of such important factors. Using a computational experiment, the authors compare the innovation performance of ecosystems with integrated firms under different interdependency structures. Design/methodology/approach: Using the NKC model, the authors incorporate non-generic complementarities and modularity into the technological interdependence between different components. The authors compare four different types of technological interdependence (modular, hierarchical, nearly modular, and random). Findings: The results show that integrated firms with centralized search demonstrate stable and consistent performance that is robust to the structure of technological interdependencies, but an ecosystem significantly outperforms integrated firms with centralized or decentralized when the products exhibit modular or nearly-modular structures. Originality/value: This study sheds light on why an ecosystem often exhibits modular structures while vertical integration is prevalent in industries with complex technological interdependence. In addition, it shows the evolutionary nature of ecosystems and indicates how the cooperation and competition between actors shape the interdependence structure of ecosystems. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ecosystem; Innovation; Interdependencies; NK model; Value appropriation; Value creation","Structure (composition); Centralised; Innovation; Interdependency; Modular structures; Modulars; NK-models; Performance; Value appropriation; Value creation; Vertical integration; Ecosystems",,,,,"20CG17; 2020PJC074; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 72102144, 72104121; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE: 21YJC630114; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS: ZD075","Funding: The authors acknowledge the funding support by National Social Science Fund of China (20&ZD075), National Natural Science Foundation of China (72102144 and 72104121), Humanities and Social Sciences Project of the Ministry of Education of China (21YJC630114), Shanghai Pujiang Program (2020PJC074) and Shanghai Chenguang Program (20CG17).",,,,,,,,,,"Adner, R., Match your innovation strategy to your innovation ecosystem (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84 (4), p. 98; Adner, R., Ecosystem as structure: an actionable construct for strategy (2017) Journal of Management, 43 (1), pp. 39-58; Adner, R., Kapoor, R., Value creation in innovation ecosystems: how the structure of technological interdependence affects firm performance in new technology generations (2010) Strategic Management Journal, 31 (3), pp. 306-333; Almirall, E., Casadesus-Masanell, R., Open versus closed innovation: a model of discovery and divergence (2010) Academy of Management Review, 35 (1), pp. 27-47; Ansari, S.S., Garud, R., Kumaraswamy, A., The disruptor's dilemma: TiVo and the U.S. television ecosystem (2016) Strategic Management Journal, 37 (9), pp. 1829-1853; Baldwin, C.Y., Where do transactions come from?

Drawing on the revised Uppsala internationalization model and network theory, this paper suggests that the effects of BG affiliation on international sales intensity and diversification depend on the geographical dispersion of the BG network ties, the size and the age of the firm, and the institutional support in the home country. Thus, we find that interfirm networks in the form of BGs are a double-edged sword that can have both favorable and unfavorable consequences for international sales, depending on the geographical dispersion of the BG's ties. In addition, the results reveal that BG affiliation is more beneficial for smaller SMEs and SMEs in countries with lower institutional support that are more dependent on the network resources embedded within BG networks. © 2022 The Authors","Business group affiliation; International sales diversification; International sales intensity; Logit fractional model; SMEs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adegbesan, J.A., Higgins, M.J., The intra-alliance division of value created through collaboration (2011) Strategic Management Journal, 32 (2), pp. 187-211; Aggarwal, R., Jindal, V., Seth, R., Board diversity and firm performance: The role of business group affiliation (2019) International Business Review, 28 (6); Aguilera, R.V., Crespí-Cladera, R., Infantes, P.M., Pascual-Fuster, B., Business groups and internationalization: Effective identification and future agenda (2020) Journal of World Business, 55 (4); Andersson, S., Internationalization in different industrial contexts (2004) Journal of Business Venturing, 19 (6), pp. 851-875; Andersson, S., Evers, N., Kuivalainen, O., International new ventures: rapid internationalization across different industry contexts (2014) European Business Review, 26 (5), pp. 390-405; Andersson, S., Sundermeier, J., Firms’ use of organizational, personal, and intermediary networks to gain access to resources for internationalization (2019) Thunderbird International Business Review, 61 (4), pp. 609-621; Ararat, M., Colpan, A.M., Matten, D., Business groups and corporate responsibility for the public good (2018) Journal of Business Ethics, 153 (4), pp. 911-929; Arregle, J.-L., Naldi, L., Nordqvist, M., Hitt, M.A., Internationalization of family-controlled firms: a study of the effects of external involvement in governance (2012) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 36 (6), pp. 1115-1143; Autio, E., Sapienza, H.J., Almeida, J.G., Effects of age at entry, knowledge intensity, and imitability on international growth (2000) Academy of Management Journal, 43 (5), pp. 909-924; Bagheri, M., Mitchelmore, S., Bamiatzi, V., Nikolopoulos, K., Internationalization Orientation in SMEs: The Mediating Role of Technological Innovation (2019) Journal of International Management, 25 (1), pp. 121-139; Bamiatzi, V., Cavusgil, S.T., Jabbour, L., Sinkovics, R.R., Does business group affiliation help firms achieve superior performance during industrial downturns?

Their work has thus been argued to have detrimental effects on their partner relationships. This paper forwards the idea that work conditions of seafarers may lead to social detachment from their close social relations (e.g. family) and that these specifically cause seafarers to exhibit a different behaviour in terms of one of the most important decisions they make when coming ashore — residential location choice. Our empirical analysis of former Danish seafarers and a sample of matched traditional workers suggests that individuals who until recently worked as seafarer to a lesser extent rely on family-based social relations than traditional workers when making residential location choices. They chose to locate close to their former peers, suggesting a shift in social attachments. The isolated lifestyles of seafarers influence social attachment. Geographic distances and social contexts are shown to interact and affect their choice of residential location. This has implications for our understanding of the well-being of seafarers and may offer new aspects on the recent development of the work conditions of seafarers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Mobility; Peers; Residential location choice; Seafarers; Social attachment; Social ties","geographical region; mobility; residential location; workplace",,,,,"Stanford University, SU; Danske Maritime Fond, DMF","The authors are grateful for the Danish Maritime Authority providing access to the micro data on seafarers.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors present a review focussing on the papers published in this special issue. The authors imported the eight accepted papers into NVivo, coding them according to the research topics posed in the call for papers. Then, the authors conducted an in vivo coding for the emerging themes found in the papers. Findings: Blockchain is a multifaced topic with multiple implications for accounting, auditing and accountability, the accounting professions, and governance. However, blockchain is still a developing topic. Blockchain research traditionally has four stages. More recently, a new research stage deserving more investigation is emerging based on the interaction of blockchain with other technological developments such as virtual reality and the metaverse. Originality/value: The review not only uncovers and systematises the multiple implications of blockchain for accounting research. It also unveils the dark side of blockchain, focusing on the technology's negative environmental and social implications.

The authors identify current trends, analyse and critique the key topics of research and discuss the future of this nascent field of inquiry. Design/methodology/approach: This study’s analysis combined a structured literature review with citation analysis, topic modelling using a machine learning approach and a manual review of selected articles. The corpus comprised 153 academic papers from two ranked journal lists, the Association of Business Schools (ABS) and the Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC), and from the Social Science Research Network (SSRN). From this, the authors analysed and critiqued the current and future research trends in the four most predominant topics of research in blockchain for accounting. Findings: Blockchain is not yet a mainstream accounting topic, and most of the current literature is normative. The four most commonly discussed areas of blockchain include the changing role of accountants; new challenges for auditors; opportunities and challenges of blockchain technology application; and the regulation of cryptoassets. While blockchain will likely be disruptive to accounting and auditing, there will still be a need for these roles. With the sheer volume of information that blockchain records, both professions may shift out of the back-office toward higher-profile advisory roles where accountants try to align competitive intelligence with business strategy, and auditors are called on ex ante to verify transactions and even whole ecosystems. Research limitations/implications: The authors identify several challenges that will need to be examined in future research. Challenges include skilling up for a new paradigm, the logistical issues associated with managing and monitoring multiple parties all contributing to various public and private blockchains, and the pressing need for legal frameworks to regulate cryptoassets. Practical implications: The possibilities that blockchain brings to information disclosure, fraud detection and overcoming the threat of shadow dealings in developing countries all contribute to the importance of further investigation into blockchain in accounting. Originality/value: The authors’ structured literature review uniquely identifies critical research topics for developing future research directions related to blockchain in accounting. © 2021, Tatiana Garanina, Mikko Ranta and John Dumay.","Accounting; Blockchain; Future trends; Literature review; Machine-learning approach",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, H., (2016) Auditing: pitch battle, , www.ft.com/content/268637f6-15c8-11e6-9d98-00386a18e39d, retrieved 20 June 2019: accessed, 30 January 2021; Al-Htaybat, K., von Alberti-Alhtaybat, L., Alhatabat, Z., Educating digital natives for the future: accounting educators' evaluation of the accounting curriculum (2018) Accounting Education, 27 (4), pp. 333-357; Allen, D.W., Berg, C., Markey-Towler, B., Novak, M., Potts, J., Blockchain and the evolution of institutional technologies: implications for innovation policy (2020) Research Policy, 49 (1); Alles, M., Examining the role of the AIS research literature using the natural experiment of the 2018 JIS conference on cloud computing (2018) International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 31, pp. 58-74; Alvesson, M., Deetz, S., (2000) Doing Critical Management Research, , Sage, London; Asmussen, C.B., Møller, C., Smart literature review: a practical topic modelling approach to exploratory literature review (2019) Journal of Big Data, 6 (1), pp. 1-18; Auer, R., (2019) Embedded supervision: how to build regulation into blockchain finance, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=3463885, accessed, 30 June 2020; Benjaafar, S., Chen, X., Taneri, N., Wan, G., (2018) A permissioned blockchain business model for green sourcing, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=3305792, accessed, 30 June 2020; Bentley, J.W., Christensen, T.E., Gee, K.H., Whipple, B.C., Disentangling managers' and analysts' non-GAAP reporting (2018) Journal of Accounting Research, 56 (4), pp. 1039-1081; Black, D.E., Black, E.L., Christensen, T.E., Gee, K.H., (2020) Comparing non-GAAP EPS in earnings announcements and proxy statements, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2343140, accessed, November 2020; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3 (4-5), pp. 993-1022; Bonsón, E., Bednárová, M., Blockchain and its implications for accounting and auditing (2019) Meditari Accountancy Research, 27 (5), pp. 725-740; Bonsón, E., Perea, D., Bednárová, M., Twitter as a tool for citizen engagement: an empirical study of the Andalusian municipalities (2019) Government Information Quarterly, 36 (3), pp. 480-489; Brown, T.B., Mann, B., Ryder, N., Subbiah, M., Kaplan, J., Dhariwal, P., Amodei, D., (2020) Language models are few-shot learners, , https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf?ref=hackernoon.com, accessed, 25 May 2021; Burragoni, V., (2017) Financial innovations: a deeper literature review with focus on India, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2894973, accessed, 30 June 2020; Cai, C.W., Disruption of financial intermediation by FinTech: a review on crowdfunding and blockchain (2018) Accounting and Finance, 58 (4), pp. 965-992; Cai, C.W., Linnenluecke, M.K., Marrone, M., Singh, A.K., Machine learning and expert judgement: analysing emerging topics in accounting and finance research in the Asia–Pacific (2019) Abacus, 55 (4), pp. 709-733; Canelón, J., Huerta, E., Incera, J., Ryan, T., A cybersecurity control framework for blockchain ecosystems (2019) The International Journal of Digital Accounting Research, 19, pp. 103-144; Cao, S.S., Ma, G., Tucker, J.W., Wan, C., Technological peer pressure and product disclosure (2018) The Accounting Review, 93 (6), pp. 95-126; Casey, M.J., Vigna, P., In blockchain we trust (2018) MIT Technology Review, 121 (3), pp. 10-16; Changati, V., Kansal, P., Factors influencing technology acceptance in the banking sector: a binary recursive partitioning approach (2019) Journal of Commerce and Accounting Research, 8 (1), pp. 68-82; Cho, S., Vasarhelyi, M.A., Zhang, C., The forthcoming data ecosystem for business measurement and assurance (2019) Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting, 16 (2), pp. 1-21; Chohan, U.W., (2017) The double spending problem and cryptocurrencies, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=3090174, accessed, 30 June 2020; Clayton, J., (2017) Statement on cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings, , https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-2017-12-11, accessed, 10 May 2021; Clohessy, T., Acton, T., Investigating the influence of organisational factors on blockchain adoption: an innovation theory perspective (2019) Industrial Management and Data Systems, 119 (7), pp. 1457-1491; Conoscenti, M., Vetro, A., De Martin, J.C., Blockchain for the Internet of Things: a systematic literature review (2016) 2016 IEEE/ACS 13th International Conference of Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA), pp. 1-6. , http://www.antoniovetro.it/authorsversion/conferences/2016-iotsms-bk.pdf, accessed, 15 May 2020; Coyne, J.G., McMickle, P.L., Can blockchains serve an accounting purpose?

This study presents the results of a structured literature review of 110 publications that developed scientometric portraits of 91 recognized scientists. Findings indicate that scientometric portraits are a growing topic in library & information science, scientometrics, and discipline-specific venues. Since 2010, the number of publications devoted to creating scientometric portraits has been growing steadily, reaching approximately seven works per year by 2019. 139 authors of scientometric portrait papers roughly fall into two categories of researchers: the majority, who have only contributed once, and a smaller group who have written many portraits and frequently cooperated with others. 65% of all scholars described in the portraits are Indian nationals. This reveals a great interest among Indian scholars in promoting domestic research. We recommend that authors of future scientometric portraits publish their work in discipline-specific outlets as such venues may better reach their target audience, focus on underrepresented disciplines, and recognize women scientists. They should also conduct a more comprehensive literature review to integrate previous findings and inform the study’s research methods to discover relevant variables, measures, metrics, and analysis techniques. Producing a scientometric portrait paper should not be considered a bibliometric exercise: the authors should put themselves in place of their readers—for instance, graduate students, academics, and policymakers—and find ways to inform and inspire them. This study also presents an archetype of scholars memorialized in scientometric portraits. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Bibliometric portrait; Bio-bibliometrics; Scholarship; Scientometric portrait; Structured literature review",,,,,,"Macquarie University","This study was supported by the Visiting International Scholar Award, Macquarie University, 2019-2020.",,,,,,,,,,"Ahirwal, A.K., Pathak, S.K., Scientometric portrait of Bharat Ratna Professor CNR Rao: A study (2015) International Journal of Engineering & Scientific Research, 3 (11), pp. 54-80; Albarrán, P., Ruiz-Castillo, J., References made and citations received by scientific articles (2011) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62 (1), pp. 40-49; Báez-Mendoza, R., Schultz, W., The role of the striatum in social behavior (2013) Frontiers in Neuroscience, 7, pp. 1-14; Cattell, J.M., A further statistical study of American men of science (1910) Science, 32 (827), pp. 633-648; Cooper, H.M., Organizing knowledge syntheses: A taxonomy of literature reviews (1988) Knowledge in Society, 1 (1), pp. 104-126; Cronin, B., (1984) The citation process: The role and significance of citations in scientific communication, , Taylor Graham; Cronin, B., Metatheorizing citation (1998) Scientometrics, 43 (1), pp. 45-55; Ding, J., Liu, C., Kandonga, G.A., Exploring the limitations of the h-index and h-type indexes in measuring the research performance of authors (2020) Scientometrics, 122 (3), pp. 1303-1322; Dumay, J., Bernardi, C., Guthrie, J., Demartini, P., Integrated reporting: A structured literature review (2016) Accounting Forum, 40 (3), pp. 166-185; Dutta, B., Biobibliometric portrait of B.K.

Relying upon the Uppsala model as applied in light of a firm case study, we contribute to the validity of the Uppsala model 2017. We respond to the counterpoint by Coviello, Kano, and Liesch (2017) to the Uppsala 2017 model, answering the question, What is the impact of Industry 4.0 on the validity of the 2017 version of the Uppsala model? This study builds on a qualitative research methodology through a single case study of Delivery Hero, a global service provider firm. We adopt an extensive longitudinal approach to understand a startup firm's digital business concept and business evolution, including its internationalization paths. We conclude that the mechanisms of the Uppsala model are valid, but their characteristics have changed by digital and globalized value-adding processes. The dynamic capabilities possessed by the founding entrepreneur turn out to constitute a critical micro foundation for the firm's international business success. Our findings explain these change mechanisms, illustrating the stepwise progression process led by entrepreneurial decision-making. Industry 4.0 technologies have changed the very manner by which ﬁrms arrange their value-adding activities with their business stakeholders in course of the firm's internationalization. By relying on reasonable business targets, algorithms, and data management systems, real-time market monitoring enables international startup firms to learn and adopt local identities faster, thereby efficiently alleviating liabilities of foreignness. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Digitalization; Entrepreneur; Firm-specific advantage; Industry 4.0; Internationalization process; Knowledge exchange; Relationship learning; Uppsala Model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahuja, G., Collaboration networks, structural holes, and innovation: A longitudinal study (2000) Administrative Science Quarterly, 45 (5), pp. 425-455; Alcácer, J., Cantwell, J., Lucia, P., Internationalization in the information age: A new era for places, firms and international business networks?

Within an ecosystem, the so-called orchestrator is considered to be one of the most important roles. However, extant research falls short of explaining how and why this orchestrator role and the resulting tasks of orchestration are allocated to specific ecosystem members. Based on a case study with eight cases, this paper aims to shed light on this crucial question. Our results revealed three basic patterns of ecosystem orchestration: single-, double-, and multi-orchestration ecosystems. These were determined by two key contingencies: production related knowledge and consumption related knowledge. This discovery yields several contributions to research and managerial practice. We show whether, and under which circumstances, orchestrators might include other ecosystem participants in the key tasks of orchestration. We demonstrate how orchestrators allocate these tasks to specific participants in the ecosystem. Furthermore, our results shed light on how orchestrators manage their ecosystem partners and secure their position within the ecosystem. And finally, we introduce a new view on the role of the orchestrator. © 2021 The Author(s)","Ecosystem; Ecosystem alignment; Multi-orchestrator; Orchestrator",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aarikka-Stenroos, L., Ritala, P., Network management in the era of ecosystems: Systematic review and management framework (2017) Industrial Marketing Management, 67, pp. 23-36; Adner, R., Match your innovation strategy to your innovation ecosystem (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84 (4), pp. 98-107; Adner, R., Ecosystem as structure: An actionable construct for strategy (2017) Journal of Management, 43 (1), pp. 39-58; Adner, R., Kapoor, R., Value creation in innovation ecosystems: How the structure of technological interdependence affects firm performance in new technology generations (2010) Strategic Management Journal, 31 (3), pp. 306-333; Adner, R., Kapoor, R., Innovation ecosystems and the pace of substitution: Re-examining technology S-curves (2016) Strategic Management Journal, 37 (4), pp. 625-648; Alexy, O., George, G., Salter, A.J., CUI BONO?

The results suggest two main points. (1) Following the current development trend, the proportion of the GDP represented by the added value of advanced high-precision industries (Gao Jing Jian in Chinese) will only be 43% in 2035, implying a limited role in promoting economic growth. Despite effective control of total energy consumption, fossil energy's share of total consumption will reach 57% by 2035, hindering the process of making the energy consumption structure cleaner and leading to failure to achieve the targeted inflection point in CO2 emissions by 2025. PM2.5 control shows some successful results and will decrease to 19 μg/m3 in 2035. However, a gap compared to other world-class cities remains.

Yet, commentators debate whether U.S. corporations have indeed moved toward a stakeholder orientation, given the difficulties in measuring such a shift. We assess this shift by examining corporate governance practices, especially the prevalence of shareholder- and stakeholder-oriented practices in chief executive officer (CEO) dismissals. Using data on large firms in 1980–2015, we found that, before the 2000s, CEOs were less heavily penalized for poor firm performance when they demonstrated a shareholder orientation by downsizing and refocusing the corporation and more heavily penalized for CSR activity. This trend, however, reversed after the early 2000s. This article provides evidence of the evolution of U.S. firms' governance practices from a shareholder toward stakeholder orientation. Managerial Summary: Many people are skeptical of the assertion that U.S. corporations have become more stakeholder-oriented over time. It is no wonder, as scant evidence exists for this claim. We tackle this claim head on by analyzing firm practices in 1980–2015 that contributed to chief executive officer (CEO) dismissal when the firm was performing poorly. Some practices, such as downsizing and firm refocusing, are associated with a shareholder orientation and others, such as CSR, are associated with a stakeholder orientation. We found strong evidence for a growing trend toward a stakeholder orientation. When the firm was performing poorly before the 2000s, CEOs were more likely to be dismissed for CSR activities and less likely to be dismissed for downsizing or refocusing the firm. This trend reversed in the early 2000s. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","CEO dismissal; corporate social responsibility; institutional theory; shareholder primacy; survival analysis","Chief executive officer; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Firm Performance; Stakeholder orientations; Shareholders",,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: 435‐2013‐1409","The authors are grateful to Ioannis Ioannou (the Editor), two anonymous reviewers, Heather Haveman, Neil Fligstein, Jiwook Jung, Roy Suddaby, Kyung-Pil Kim, and Maoliang Bu for their helpful comments and suggestions in previous drafts of this article.

In this article, the CH-X12 /STL-X framework for e-waste recycling scale prediction is proposed based on the idea of ‘decomposition-integration’, considering that the seasonal data characteristics of quarterly e-waste recycling scale data may lead to large forecasting errors and inconsistent forecasting results of a traditional single model. First, the seasonal data characteristics of the time series of e-waste recovery scale are identified based on Canova–Hansen (CH) test, and then the time series suitable for seasonal decomposition is extracted with X12 or seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL) model for seasonal components. Then, the Holt–Winters model was used to predict the seasonal component, and the support vector regression (SVR) model was used to predict the other components. Finally, the linear sum of the prediction results of each component is used to obtain the final prediction result. The empirical results show that the proposed CH-X12/STL-X forecasting framework can better meet the modelling requirements for time-series forecasting driven by different seasonal data characteristics and has better and more stable forecasting performance than traditional single models (Holt–Winters model, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model and SVR model). © The Author(s) 2021.","data trait-driven modelling; decomposition-integration; E-waste; integrated forecasting; seasonal decomposition","Data integration; Electronic Waste; Integration; Recycling; Time series; Wastes; Data characteristics; Data trait-driven modeling; Decomposition-integration; E-waste recycling; E-wastes; Integrated forecasting; Seasonal datum; Seasonal decomposition; Single models; Times series; Forecasting; decomposition analysis; electronic waste; forecasting method; modeling; recycling; waste management; article; decomposition; e-waste; forecasting; prediction; support vector machine; time series analysis; winter; forecasting; recycling; season; time factor; Electronic Waste; Forecasting; Recycling; Seasons; Time Factors",,,,,,"The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.",,,,,,,,,,"Abbondanza, M.N.M., Souza, R.G., Estimating the generation of household e-waste in municipalities using primary data from surveys: A case study of Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil (2019) Waste Management, 85, pp. 374-384; Afonso, A., Agnello, L., Furceri, D., Assessing long-term fiscal developments: A new approach (2011) Journal of International Money and Finance, 30, pp. 130-146; Ahmad, R.W., Salah, K., Jayaraman, R., Blockchain-based forward supply chain and waste management for COVID-19 medical equipment and supplies (2021) IEEE Access, 9, pp. 44905-44927; Althaf, S., Babbitt, C.W., Chen, R., Forecasting electronic waste flows for effective circular economy planning (2019) Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 151, p. 104362; Awasthi, A.K., Li, J., Koh, L., Circular economy and electronic waste (2019) Nature Electronics, 2, pp. 86-89; Beneki, C., Eeckels, B., Leon, C., Signal extraction and forecasting of the UK tourism income time series: A singular spectrum analysis approach (2012) Journal of Forecasting, 31, pp. 391-400; Canova, F., Hansen, B.E., Are seasonal patterns constant over time?

Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study of a qualitative nature was conducted using a self-administered open-ended questionnaire among tourists who had stayed in an Airbnb in the past three years. Data were collected using two different sources for triangulation purposes, referred to as Studies 1 and 2. Findings: Many respondents reported conducting similar activities while at home and while staying in an Airbnb, supporting Burch’s (1969) spill-over theory. Travellers mostly recalled mundane activities, such as cooking. The results suggest that the spill-over effect is more prevalent in the Airbnb context than in other accommodation types, as one often travels from one’s own home to another’s home. Respondents associated their Airbnb experience with the positive emotion of joy. Respondents mentioned numerous reasons for having felt joy during their Airbnb experiences, such as sharing the trip with travel companions and spending time with friends. Practical implications: Airbnb should clearly define host’s tasks and responsibilities, hosts should treat guests in a friendly manner, which includes resolving any problems they face in relation to the rental property. Originality/value: This paper proposes a new conceptual framework for a memorable Airbnb experience, which comprises several components: socialising and bonding with friends and family members, location, the host’s hospitality, a homely feeling, home amenities and negative experiences (the poor condition of the room and a dishonest host). © 2021, Erose Sthapit, Peter Björk Dafnis N.

Nevertheless, most research treats this dissolution with a sense of finality. Using the Danish Integrated Database for Labor Market Research (IDA), we explore the persistence of cofounders and early employees to continue their work relationships after the dissolution of the new venture. We investigate where these team members continue their career and whether they pursue entrepreneurship together in another new venture. Overall, over 18.3% move jointly, and comobility is more prevalent among new venture team members who worked jointly prior to founding the new venture and among those new venture teams demonstrating high levels of homogeneity. Moreover, comovers tend toward small firms, and comobility occurs largely in similar industry. A large share of comovers move to new ventures, which is indicative of serial or habitual new venture teams. This also raises further question on team-level dimension of learning from failure. © 2021, The Author(s).","Comobility; Dissolution; Failure; J60; J62; J65; L26; M13; New Venture Teams",,,,,,"Universitetet i Agder, UiA","We would like to thank Mirjam van Praag, Diego Zunino, Martin Murmann, Emilie-Pauline Gallié, Mette Præst Knudsen, Michael S.

Based on a sample of 87 European banks over the period 2010–2016, we provide evidence that ownership concentration has a non-monotonic (inverted u-shape) relationship with systemic risk. Additionally, we find that board characteristics (board size and gender) affect a bank’s systemic risk, but for small banks only. Overall, our evidence suggests that the traditional banks’ size-focused approach to systemic risk study should be complemented with governance dimensions, especially in a context like the European one, where ownership concentration is high. Our results also imply that practitioners and policymakers should promote better governance practices in banks in the form of more adequate ownership and board structures that are better able to control systemic risk. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Banks; Board composition; Ownership structure; Systemic risk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acharya, V.V., Engle, R., Richardson, M., Capital shortfall: A new approach to ranking and regulating systemic risks (2012) American Economic Review, 102, pp. 59-64; Acharya, V.V., Pedersen, L.H., Philippon, T., Richardson, M., (2009) Regulating systemic risk, chapter 13, pp. 283-304. , Wiley, Hoboken; Acharya, V.V., Volpin, P., Corporate governance externalities (2010) Review of Finance, 14 (1), pp. 1-33; Acharya, V.V., Pedersen, L.H., Philippon, T., Richardson, M.P., Measuring systemic risk (2017) The Review of Financial Studies, 30 (1), pp. 2-47; Acharya, V.V., Schnabl, P., Suarez, G., Securitization without risk transfer (2013) International Journal of Financial Economics, 107 (3), pp. 515-536; Acharya, V.V., Steffen, S., Analyzing systemic risk of the European banking sector (2012) Handbook on systemic risk, , Fouque JP, Langsam J, (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Adachi-Sato, M., Vithessonthi, C., Bank systemic risk and corporate investment: Evidence from the US (2017) International Review of Financial Analysis., 50, pp. 151-163; Adams, R.B., Governance and the financial crisis (2012) International Review of Finance, 12 (1), pp. 7-38; Adams, R.B., Ferreira, D., A theory of friendly boards (2007) Journal of Finance, 62 (1), pp. 217-250; Adams, R.B., Ferreira, D., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance (2009) Journal of Financial Economics, 94 (2), pp. 291-309; Adams, R.B., Funk, P., Beyond the glass ceiling: Does gender matter?

Design/methodology/approach: In total, the study uses 138 peer-reviewed articles on effectuation, causation, effectual/causal decision-making logics and related issues such as the impact of antecedent factors of international strategy (i.e. effectuation, causation and bricolage) on the international performance of the firm. Findings: Even though the theory of effectuation was formulated in 2001, to a large extent it has still not moved away from the realm of small entrepreneurial firms. The development of effectuation logic has accelerated in recent years, but the bulk of the research still focusses on small entrepreneurial firms rather than on the application of the theory in larger, non-entrepreneurial firms. Furthermore, effectuation theory would benefit from being developed into the realm of psychology and sociology. Originality/value: This study offers a conceptual model on how effectuation, causation and bricolage influence internationalisation strategy, which, in turn, impacts the international performance of the firm. Furthermore, the study discusses the effectual logic for larger firms. The exponential growth of studies on effectuation during recent years, i.e. 2017 to the first quarter of 2020, shows that researchers have responded to calls by leading authors stating that effectuation theory is a field with great potential for further theoretical developments. This study presents a literature review of the critical issue of the engagement of internationalisation strategies with effectuation, causation, bricolage and the international performance of the firm compared to the earlier literature review for the period 2001–2016 by Matalamäki (2017) and Karami et al. (2019) on effectuation and internationalisation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bricolage; Causation; Effectuation; International performance of the firm; Internationalisation strategy; Literature review",,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and the two co-editors of this journal ?Review of International Business and Strategy? for their constructive comments and suggestions throughout the review process.",,,,,,,,,,"Alqahtani, N., Uslay, C., Entrepreneurial marketing and firm performance: synthesis and conceptual development (2020) Journal of Business Research, 113, pp. 62-71; Alsos, G.A., Clausen, T.H., Hytti, U., Solvoll, S., Entrepreneurs, social identity and the preference of causal and effectual behaviours in start-up processes (2016) Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 28 (3-4), pp. 234-258; Alsos, G.A., Clausen, T.H., Mauer, R., Read, S., Sarasvathy, S.D., Effectual exchange: from entrepreneurship to the disciplines and beyond (2019) Small Business Economics, 54 (3), pp. 605-619; An, W., Ruling, C.C., Zheng, X., Zhang, J., Configurations of effectuation, causation and bricolage: implications for firm growth paths (2020) Small Business Economics, 54 (3), pp. 843-864; Anderson, A.R., Younis, S., Hashim, H., Air, C., Social enterprising informing our concept: exploring informal micro social enterprise (2019) Social Enterprise Journal, 15 (1), pp. 94-110; Andersson, S., International entrepreneurship, born globals and the theory of effectuation (2011) Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 18 (3), pp. 627-664; Anosike, P., Entrepreneurship education knowledge transfer in a conflict sub-Saharan African context (2018) Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 25 (4), pp. 591-608; Arend, R.J., Sarooghi, H., Burkemper, A., Effectuation as ineffectual?

Using this methodology, we are able to compute similarities between all existing patents, which in turn enables us to represent the whole patent universe as a technological network. We validate both technological signature and similarity in various ways and, using the case of electric vehicle technologies, demonstrate their usefulness in measuring knowledge flows, mapping technological change, and creating patent quality indicators.

The results reveal that social trust among acquaintances and social trust among strangers have heterogeneous impacts on corporate collaborative innovation: Trust in strangers promotes firms’ collaborative innovation more than trust in acquaintances. We then analyze the external governance effects of blockchain applications, including the direct impact of blockchain applications on firms’ collaborative innovation, and the indirect impact of blockchain applications on the relationship between social trust and corporate collaborative innovation. We find that blockchain application enhances collaborative innovation and strengthens the positive impact of social trust on collaborative innovation. These results indicate that the application of blockchain technology improves the performances of firms’ collaborative innovation. It is therefore advisable for firms and governments to construct an ecosystem to facilitate the application of blockchain technologies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Blockchain application; Collaborative innovation; Digital economy; Social trust","Economic and social effects; Manufacture; Block-chain; Blockchain application; Collaborative innovation; Corporates; Digital economy; Direct impact; Industry based; Manufacturing industries; Performance; Social trust; Blockchain; digitization; industrial performance; innovation; manufacturing; China",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 72104121; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Social Science Fund of China, NSSFC: ZD075","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72104121 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences (No. 20&ZD075 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Aceto, G., Persico, V., Pescapé, A., Industry 4.0 and health: internet of things, big data, and cloud computing for healthcare 4.0 (2020) J.

Such low-leverage customers must find other ways of making themselves attractive to coveted suppliers. In this paper, we study how customers with low leverage manage the process of mobilizing supplier resources critical for innovation. We present findings from a single case study of a buying firm and show how they use five elements to gradually become attractive in the eyes of a critical supplier: proactive technological competence, canvassing and continuous communication, supplier learning, market access, and relationship maintenance. The different elements play different roles during the process of mobilizing supplier resources. We show that mobilizing suppliers in the case of low-leverage customers is a long-term process in which a number of interrelated attractiveness elements are leveraged in a complex pattern. This process is highly resource-demanding and requires substantial dedication and effort from the customer organization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Buyer-supplier relationships; Customer attractiveness; Innovation; Resource mobilization; Supplier involvement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barratt, M., Choi, T.Y., Li, M., Qualitative case studies in operations management: trends, research outcomes, and future research implications (2011) J.

The underlying premise is that if a firm continues to collaborate with a university, it must consider that collaboration to be valuable. A quantitative analysis of over 2600 firms reveals that persistence is relatively common in university–industry collaborations on innovation, with more than a third of firms that engage in university collaboration continuing to collaborate with the same university over two consecutive periods. In addition, the analysis shows that firms’ investments in collaborative capabilities and different dimensions of absorptive capacity are instrumental for persistent collaboration with a university. Furthermore, persistent collaboration with a university is strongly associated with the strategic choice to engage in sustained collaboration with a broad range of partner types. Finally, the analysis reveals that geographical proximity between a firm and a university may facilitate the initiation of a collaboration, although the nearest university is not necessarily the most suitable partner. This is illustrated by the finding that geographical proximity between a firm and a university does not matter for keeping together in a persistent collaboration. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Absorptive capacity; Collaborative capabilities; Geographical proximity; Openness; Technically oriented universities; University graduates; University–industry collaboration","Absorptive capacity; Geographical proximity; Industry collaboration; Strategic choice; University collaborations; Engineering",,,,,,"Persistence is defined as collaboration with a university in the two consecutive periods 2010–2012 and 2013–2015. In the survey, collaboration is conditional on innovation activity. Furthermore, collaboration is not necessarily contractually formalised or supported by public funds. Innovation activities are defined as having introduced new or significantly improved products, manufacturing processes, operations, organisational structures or marketing methods within the analysed period, or as having ongoing or abandoned innovation activities during the period covered by the survey. As firms that participate in the survey are asked about all of their innovation activities, they can have several ongoing as well as completed innovation activities at the same time. This is the case for approximately half of the innovative companies. It is not possible to determine from the survey whether the collaboration with a university during the period 2010–2012 involved a completed or an ongoing innovation project (or both). If the collaboration in 2010–2012 involves an ongoing innovation project, then collaboration in both periods 2010–2012 and 2013–2015 may reflect a long-term project collaboration rather than a repeated collaboration. However, in terms of persistence, the differences between long-term and repeated collaborations may not be substantial because projects without progress or perceived value added are likely to be terminated.3 We have tested the validity of this assumption by exploring the relation between persistence and firms’ perception of the importance of using universities as a source of innovation. The results show a positive association between persistence and perceived importance.",,,,,,,,,,"Ankrah, S.N., Burgess, T.F., Grimshaw, P., Shaw, N.E., Asking both university and industry actors about their engagement in knowledge transfer: what single-group studies of motives omit (2013) Technovation, 33 (2-3), pp. 50-65; Bekkers, R., Bodas-Freitas, I.M., Analysing knowledge transfer channels between universities and industry: to what degree do sectors also matter?

We show that the effects of AI are varied and depend on whether AI is used for providing orders to humans or providing information for further human handling and in which occupation it is used. AI may enhance or augment skills through, for example, the increased use of high-performance work practices, or it may increase work pace constraints and reduce employee autonomy. The results imply that the diffusion of AI can increase inequalities in the labour market by augmenting skills used in high-skill jobs, although having relatively more adverse impacts on other jobs. We use additive noise modelling to establish the likely direction of causality in our results and find that the direction of causality is from AI use to skill requirements. © 2021 Brian Towers (BRITOW) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","additive noise modelling; artificial intelligence; autonomy; constraints; high-performance work practices; job requirements approach; learning; skills","artificial intelligence; data set; employment; labor market; learning; numerical model; occupation; Denmark",,,,,,"We thank participant at the joint online workshop on “Technological Change and Regional Inequalities” by the School of Business, Economics and Law at the University of Gothenburg and Aalborg University Business School for valuable comments.

Content analysis is used to assess the mandatory disclosure of BM in in 75 publicly listed companies' annual reports across a three-year period (2014–2016). The research applies a novel content analysis methodology that considers the way in which the relevance of BM disclosures is dependent on which particular BM a given company adopts. The empirical results show notably low levels of BM disclosure and no significant association between BM disclosures and market value. However, we find that BM disclosure provides insights into earnings quality by means of enhanced earnings persistence. These findings reveal that information about the BM itself does not make a difference to investors when it is not linked to financial outcomes. Instead, BM acts as a framework for organizing other disclosures, and provides complementary information about value generation, helping users understand how earnings are generated. These results are important for informing the policy-making process around extra-financial disclosures (e.g., EU Directive 2014/95/EU) and answer calls for research to inform future improvements to corporate and integrated reporting. © 2021 Accounting Foundation, The University of Sydney.","Business models; Earnings persistence; Narrative reporting; Non-financial disclosure; Non-financial regulation; Value relevance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Afuah, A., Tucci, C.L., A Model of the Internet as Creative Destroyer (2003) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 50 (4), pp. 395-402; (1994) Improving Business Reporting – A Customer Focus: Meeting the Information Needs of Investors and Creditors – A Comprehensive Report of the Special Committee on Financial Reporting, American Institute of Certified Public, , Accountants, New York; Amir, E., Lev, B., Value-relevance of Nonfinancial Information: The Wireless Communications Industry (1996) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 22, pp. 3-30; Amir, E., Lev, B., Sougiannis, T., Do Financial Analysts Get Intangibles?

High-performer mobility induces a loss of human assets but might also enable competition by transferring human and complementary assets from the parent firm to a competitor. Only when such transfer occurs is mobility to same-industry startups more harmful than other types of high-performer mobility. Human and complementary asset transfer is conditional on the departing high performer's ability to accumulate (and hence transfer) knowledge from the parent firm and the recipient firm's ability to absorb such knowledge. In support of this hypothesis, we show that the high performer's tenure and the startup's resources (size) moderate the performance effect of high-performer mobility on same-industry startups. Managerial Summary: Industry experience is critical for new venture performance, and spinoff entrepreneurs (former employees from the same industry) perform better than other start-ups. However, studies have found that high performers' mobility to spinoffs harms the performance of their former employers. This paper asks when do spinoffs result in increasing competition and when is spinoff entrepreneurship more harmful compared to other types of high performer mobility? We show that additional detrimental performance effects on former employers depend on employee tenure and the spinoffs' start-up size. We argue that longer tenure increases competition because it allows the employee to form and strengthen personal relations, for example, to customers, and to accumulate more knowledge on products and processes. Start-up size is important for the recreation and appropriation of this knowledge. © 2021 Strategic Management Society.","complementary assets; high-performer mobility; human assets; parent firm performance; spinoffs",,,,,,"275‐08‐0259","The Independent Research Council|Social Science (Grant No. 275‐08‐0259) provided funding for this project.

Møllers Allé 8, Aarhus C, DK-8000, Denmark","Nitrogen (N) provides the agriculture industry with a wicked problem: it is an essential nutrient for efficient crop production, but N losses from agricultural production can harm both the stability of the environment and the health of humans. To limit this, targeted N regulation at the ID15 (1500 ha) level is slowly becoming a reality for farmers and authorities in Denmark. This paper explores the formulation of value propositions connected to developed technologies and concepts for retention mapping at the field level for more detailed targeted regulation. We explore all this through a comprehensive longitudinal ethnographic case study over a period of three years. We use the value proposition canvas to make sense of the viewpoints of the involved stakeholder groups. Our empirical setting is a large-scale research project in Denmark, a country that has high environmental goals regarding nitrogen loading. The publicly funded project involved a multitude of stakeholders, ranging from industry consultants, regulators, farmers and researchers from several disciplines. Important for our study is the fact that much of Denmark's regulation is based on a consensus-driven approach. Thus, it provides a compelling setting for exploring the creation of value propositions through multisector stakeholder engagement. Our findings indicate that, while there is a general movement towards targeted N regulation due to an advancement of knowledge, the practical side of its implementation is less straightforward. Here, stakeholder-formulated value propositions can facilitate this process, not only being connected to the measurement technology, but also relying on a link to a regulatory transformation. © 2022 The Authors","Aquatic pollution; Governance model; Groundwater nitrogen retention; Nitrogen fertilizer; Stakeholder engagement; Triple helix; Value propositions","Cultivation; Groundwater pollution; Nitrogen fertilizers; Aquatic pollution; Denmark; Governance models; Groundwater nitrogen retention; Nitrogen regulation; Nitrogen retention; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainable values; Triple helixes; Value proposition; Groundwater",,,,,"Innovationsfonden, IFD: 8850-00025B","This research was supported by the Innovation Fund Denmark projects: MapField – Field scale mapping for targeted N-regulation and management ( 8850-00025B ).",,,,,,,,,,"Allee, V., Reconfiguring the value network (2000) J.

This paper aims to explore this relationship and advance its theoretical and practical understanding. It further contributes toward Fintech paradigm and research domain emergence that both to date remain yet elusive. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopted a multiple-case study strategy for the purpose of theory building. Seven players from the Fintech ecosystem in Quebec (Canada) were selected, representing financial institutions, Fintech start-ups and Quebec’s financial cluster. Primary data was collected via in-depth interviews with ten respondents at the level of vice presidents, Managers, directors, chief executive officers and founders, and unobtrusive data – in the form of running records, mass-media news reports, presentations and proceedings from Fintech events. Data analysis was informed by grounded theory methods and techniques. Findings: Grounded in data, this paper puts forward a typology of “comfort zoning” and its four types: nimbling, imperiling, cocooning and discomforting. Research limitations/implications: Following the tenets of the grounded theory, four criteria are used to evaluate the emergent theory: fit, relevance, workability and modifiability. It is expected the interpretation and adoption of comfort zoning typology will be challenged, modified and enhanced by Fintech researchers and practitioners. Practical implications: The comfort zoning typology would aid practitioners in their efforts to define and refine the domain of Fintech, problematize it and eventually enhance the relationship between Fintechs. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to explore the relationship between Fintechs and incumbents and advance the theoretical and practical understanding of this relationship. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Comfort zoning typology; Ecosystem; Fintech; Inductive research; Innovation; Theory building",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckey, R.P., Fintech, regtech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2016) Northwestern Journal of International Law & Business, 37 (3), pp. 371-414; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckey, R.P., The evolution of FinTech: a new post-crisis paradigm (2017) Georgetown Journal of International Law, 47 (4), pp. 1271-1320; Bofondi, M., Gobbi, G., The big promise of fintech (2017) European Economy, 2, pp. 107-119; Bömer, M., Maxin, H., Why Fintechs cooperate with banks – evidence from Fermany (2018) Zeitschrift Für Die Gesamte Versicherungswissenschaft, 107 (4), pp. 359-386; Boot, A., The future of banking: from scale and scope economies to fintech (2017) European Economy, 2, pp. 77-95; Brinkmann, S., Kvale, S., (2015) InterViews: Learning the Craft of Qualitative Research Interviewing, , Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA; Dareolles, S., The rise of FinTechs and their regulations (2016) Financial Stability Review, 20, pp. 85-92; Dholakia, N., Turcan, R.V., Bubbles: towards a typology (2013) Foresight, 15 (2), pp. 79-88; Dholakia, N., Turcan, R.V., (2014) Toward a Metatheory of Economic Bubbles: Socio-Political and Cultural Perspectives, , Palgrave Macmillan, New York, NY; Dyer, G., Wilkins, A., Better stories, not better constructs, to generate better theory: a rejoinder to Eisenhardt (1991) The Academy of Management Review, 16 (3), pp. 613-619; Frame, W.S., Wall, L., White, L.J., (2018) Technological change and financial innovation in banking: some implications for fintech, , http://dx.doi.org/10.29338/wp2018-11, doi:, Working paper, 2018-11, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA; (2017) Financial stability implications from FinTech: supervisory and regulatory issues that merit authorities’ attention, , https://bit.ly/2ELMAFU, accessed 15 May 2020; (2019) FinTech and market structure in financial services: market developments and potential financial stability implications, , https://bit.ly/31EtdaF, accessed 15 May 2020; Gai, K., Qiu, K., Sun, X., A survey on FinTech (2018) Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 103, pp. 262-273; Glaser, B., (1978) Theoretical Sensitivity, , Sociology Press, CA; Glaser, B., (2001) The Grounded Theory Perspective: Conceptualization Contrasted with Description, , Sociology Press, CA; Glaser, B., (2005) The Grounded Theory Perspective III, , Theoretical Coding, Sociology Press, CA; Glaser, B., Strauss, A., (2000) The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, , Aldine Publishing Company, Chicago; Goldstein, I., Jiang, W., Karolyi, G.A., To FinTech and beyond (2019) The Review of Financial Studies, 32 (5), pp. 1647-1661; (2017) FinTech developments in the insurance industry, , https://bit.ly/2XYaLcg, International Association of Insurance Supervisors: accessed 8 July 2019; Kowalewski, O., Pisany, P., (2020) The rise of fintech: a cross-country perspective, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=3624456, SSRN; Lee, I., Shin, Y.J., Fintech: ecosystem, business models, investment decisions, and challenges (2018) Business Horizons, 61 (1), pp. 35-46; Lovallo, D., Kahneman, D., Delusions of success: how optimism undermines executives‘decisions (2003) Harvard Business Review, 81 (7), pp. 56-73; LuWangWu, H., Ye, J., (2020) Fintech and the future of financial service: a literature review and research agenda, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=3600627, SSRN; Lulic, M., (2020) How millennials and fintechs are disrupting the way we borrow and invest, , https://bit.ly/31G9kjS, Forbes: accessed 15 May 2020; Mansilla-Fernandez, J.M., A bird eye (re)view of key readings (2017) European Economy, 2, pp. 51-60; Merton, R., Insiders and outsiders: a chapter in the sociology of knowledge (1972) American Journal of Sociology, 78 (1), pp. 9-47; Miles, M., Huberman, M., (1994) Qualitative Data Analysis: An Expanded Sourcebook, , Sage, London; Muhovic, K., (2020) 10 Innovative FinTech business models, , https://bit.ly/3gDDxE7, Board of Innovation: accessed 7 June 2020; Navaretti, G.B., Calzolari, G., Pozzolo, A.F., FinTech and banks: friends or foes?

We investigate two types of aggregation biases that might affect CCH tests. First, monthly commodity prices are sometimes averaged across all days of the month, a practice that creates substantial spurious predictability in price changes. Second, in CCH tests commodity prices are often grouped into an index. If all commodity prices do not react equally fast to news, the active goods’ prices should lead those of the slower-acting ones and therefore predict the index. If so, the currency's value changes can proxy for these active goods’ prices. We find a strong bias from price averaging in monthly returns, while the bias from ignoring predictability among commodities seems weak. When testing the CCH using end-of-period data the supporting evidence is weak at best. © 2021","Commodity prices; Exchange rates; Forecasting; Present value model",,,,,,"Educational Foundation of America, EFA; Deutsche Bundesbank","☆ We thank Christiane Baumeister, Yu-chin Chen, Christophe Croux, Pasquale Della Corte, Geert Dhaene, Pablo Pincheira, Stig Vinther Møller and numerous seminar and conference participants at the 22nd Symposium of the Society for Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics in New York; the 20th International Conference Computing in Economics and Finance in Oslo; the 10th BMRC-DEMS Conference in London; the 41st European Financial Association (EFA) annual meeting in Lugano; the Chilean Central Bank; Deutsche Bundesbank; and seminars at Aalborg, KU Leuven, Wisconsin-Madison, McGill, and Laval.

We develop a large-scale stock-flow consistent model. The model has five main sectors namely, household, firms, financial corporations, government, and the rest of the world sectors. We use the model to explore the macroeconomic stability of the Danish economy, given the recent level of household debt. We fit the model to annual data from 1998 to 2016, estimate the structural parameters, and simulate the model for a baseline scenario, against which we compare and contrast the effects of different economic shocks. To assess the macroeconomic risks associated with high household debt, we introduce two shocks separately—a fall in house prices and a rise in interest rates—finding that these shocks have adverse effects on the economy. Focusing on macroeconomic stability, we find that private domestic demand seems to be relatively sensitive to the changes in interest rates and house prices, but the overall output is less affected, mainly due to strong current account surplus. Overall, it can be concluded that in the absence of global shocks, domestic shocks to the economy may not pose a serious risk to macroeconomic stability, when purely focusing on the sensitivity of output growth and unemployment. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2013) A model of the Danish economy, , Danmarks Statistik; Aladangady, A., Housing wealth and consumption: Evidence from geographically-linked microdata (2017) American Economic Review, 107 (11), pp. 3415-3446. , https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20150491; Alter, A., Xiaochen Feng, A., Valckx, N., (2018) Understanding the macro-financial effects of household debt: A global perspective, , International Monetary Fund; Andersen, A.L., Duus, C., Jensen, T.L., Household debt and spending during the financial crisis: Evidence from Danish micro data (2016) European Economic Review, 89, pp. 96-115. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.06.006; Armington, P.S., A theory of demand for products distinguished by place of production (1969) Staff Papers, 16 (1), pp. 159-178; Household debt: Recent developments and challenges (2017) BIS Quarterly Review, December, pp. 39-54; Burgess, S., Burrows, O., Godin, A., Kinsella, S., Millard, S., (2016) A dynamic model of financial balances for the United Kingdom, , Bank of England Working Paper 614., SSRN Electronic Journal; Byrialsen, M.R., Raza, H., Macroeconomic effects of unemployment benefits in small open economies: A stock–flow consistent approach (2018) European Journal of Economics and Economic Policies: Intervention, 15 (3), pp. 335-363; Byrialsen, M.R., Raza, H., (2020) An empirical stock-flow consistent macroeconomic model for Denmark, , Working Paper 942., Levy Economics Institute; Caldera, A., Johansson, Å., The price responsiveness of housing supply in OECD countries (2013) Journal of Housing Economics, 22 (3), pp. 231-249. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhe.2013.05.002; Caverzasi, E., Godin, A., Financialisation and the sub-prime crisis: A stock-flow consistent model (2015) European Journal of Economics and Economic Policies: Intervention, 12 (1), pp. 73-92; Cecchetti, S.G., Mohanty, M.S., Zampolli, F., (2011) The real effects of debt, pp. 1-33. , .

Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper seeks to foster the debate on the crucial role of risk reporting considering the impact and uncertainty caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and stakeholder information needs in this context. The authors draw upon neo-Durkheimian institutional and legitimacy theories and elements of the accounting and risk management literature to discuss the challenges that the pandemic poses to risk recognition and assessment and the subsequent disclosure decision of risk information. Findings: Risk reporting has its roots in risk recognition and assessment. To live up to their accountability in these times of uncertainty, organisations need to address their stakeholders' new and changing information needs. Ad hoc disclosures and linking risk management and reporting to their business models (BM) would improve the risk recognition and assessment practices and the meaningfulness of the disclosed information. Hence, we provide some examples and discuss potential avenues to address these challenges and adapt risk reporting accordingly. Originality/value: This conceptual paper contributes to the risk reporting and accountability research fields. Previous studies on communication during a crisis have focused on sustainability reporting. Thus, this study contributes to that literature by considering the role of risk reporting in times of an unexpected large-scale global crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and by highlighting possibilities for moving risk reporting towards becoming more accountability based. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accountability-based accounting; COVID-19; Dynamic accountability; Dynamic materiality; Risk reporting; Stakeholder engagement",,,,,,,"The authors thankfully acknowledge the insightful comments from two anonymous reviewers and the guidance from the handling guest editor Giulia Leoni and the guest editorial team during the revisions of this article.

They are based on complementarities, which can take the form of supermodularity or uniqueness and appear on both production and consumption side. Different configurations of complementarity lead to different characteristics of ecosystems with different implications. But which configuration of complementarities is beneficial in a given setting and what are the resulting consequences? We study emerging ecosystems driven by the respective orchestrator. Based on a multiple-case study, we show how and why orchestrators are leveraging different configurations of complementarities depending on, amongst others, competition on ecosystem or value proposition level and uncertainty and the resulting challenges for the orchestrator. These insights provide researchers with a better understanding of the basic mechanics of ecosystems and explain why certain types and structures of ecosystems are more likely to be seen in specific environments. For managers, it helps to sketch the development paths for own ecosystems. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","complementarity; Ecosystem; ecosystem blueprint; ecosystem management;

A major goal is to transfer more than 50% of road transport to rail or waterways within 2050. To meet this challenge waterway transport needs to get more attractive and overcome its disadvantages. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new knowledge and technology and find a completely new approach to short sea and inland waterways shipping. A key element in this is automation of ships, ports and administrative tasks aligned to requirements of different European regions. One main goal in the AEGIS project is to increase the efficiency of the waterways transport with the use of higher degrees of automation corresponding with new and smaller ship types to reduce costs and secure higher frequency by feeders and provide multimodal green logistics solutions combining short sea shipping with rail and road transport. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Freight transportation; Inland waterways; Roads and streets; Inland seas; Intermodal system; Key elements; Maritime transport; Road transports; Short sea shipping; Sustainable growth; Transport policy; Transport systems; Waterborne transport; Ships",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 859992","The AEGIS project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant Agreement N°859992.

The assessment is grounded in the empirical material of a three-year research project on integrated reporting (IR). Design/methodology/approach: Alvesson and Deetz’s (2021) critical management framework structures the arguments in this paper. By investigating local phenomena and the extant literature, the authors glean insights that they later critique, drawing on the empirical evidence collected during the research project. Transformative redefinitions are then proposed that point to future opportunities for research on voluntary organisational disclosures. Findings: The authors argue that the mainstream approaches to VRD, namely, incremental information and legitimacy theories, present shortcomings in addressing why and how organisations voluntarily disclose information. First, the authors find that companies adopting the International IR Council’s (IIRC, 2021) IR framework tend to comply with the framework only in an informal, rather than a substantial way. Second, the authors find that, at times, organisations serendipitously chance upon VRD practices such as IR instead of rationally recognising the potential ability of such practices to provide useful information for decision-making by investors. Also, powerful groups in organisations may use VRD practices to establish, maintain or restore power balances in their favour. Research limitations/implications: The paper’s limitations stem directly from its aim to be a critical reflection. Even when grounded on empirics, a reflection is mainly a subjective effort. Therefore, different researchers could come to different conclusions and offer different lessons from the two case studies. Practical implications: The different rationales the authors found for VRD should make a case for reporting institutions to tone down any investor-centric rhetoric in favour of more substantial disclosures. The findings imply that reporting organisations should approach the different frameworks with a critical eye and read between the lines of these frameworks to determine whether the purported normative arguments are achievable practice. Originality/value: The authors reflect on timely and relevant issues linked to recent developments in the VRD landscape. Further, the authors offer possible ways forward for critical research that may rely on different methodological choices, such as interventionist and post-structuralist research. © 2022, Giacomo Pigatto, Lino Cinquini, John Dumay and Andrea Tenucci.","Critical research; Figurational theory; Integrated reporting; Serendipity; Voluntary disclosure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2021) A4S aims, , www.accountingforsustainability.org/en/about-us/overview.html, (accessed: 3 November 2021; Adams, C.A., Internal organisational factors influencing corporate social and ethical reporting: beyond current theorising (2002) Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 15 (2), pp. 223-250; Adams, C.A., The international integrated reporting council: a call to action (2015) Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 27, pp. 23-28; Ahmed Haji, A., Anifowose, M., Initial trends in corporate disclosures following the introduction of integrated reporting practice in South Africa (2017) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 18 (2), pp. 373-399; Alvesson, M., Deetz, S., (2021) Doing Critical Research, , 2nd ed., Sage Publications; Andon, P., Baxter, J., Chua, W.F., Accounting change as relational drifting: a field study of experiments with performance measurement (2007) Management Accounting Research, 18 (2), pp. 273-308; Armitage, S., Marston, C., Corporate disclosure, cost of capital and reputation: evidence from finance directors (2008) The British Accounting Review, 40 (4), pp. 314-336; Aston, J., CPA’s annus horribilis (2018) The Australian Financial Review, , www.afr.com, (accessed: 30 December 2021; Barker, R., Teixeira, A., Are integrated reporting and IFRS competing frameworks?

The seafood sector is not only among the culprits, but is also among the most affected by this threat to the marine environment. Earlier research has pointed to fishing gear take-back schemes as a measure to mitigate the problem, and policymakers have embraced the idea. The Norwegian scheme for beverage containers has been hailed as a benchmark for the application of Extended Producer Responsibility. Through the lens of business ecosystems, we draw parallels between the existing take-back scheme for beverage containers and the latent system for fishing gear to answer the question: “What would it take to establish a take-back scheme for fishing gear?” We elaborate upon four factors that are well established for beverage container take-back schemes, but lacking or unclear in the case of fishing gear: (i) politico-institutional support, (ii) the system's value proposition, (iii) the system integrator, and (iv) operational factors (i.e., a network of collection points and procedures, and material variety and complexity). Our findings highlight that when innovations are not based on the usual market mechanisms, unconventional conceptualizations of value itself and how value is mapped and distributed are required. Meaningful engagement of the private sector depends upon either explicit articulation of value capture or policy instruments to enforce responsibility; both are currently either unclear or lacking in the context of fishing gear. © 2022 The Authors.

However, economic, management, and technology forecasting research has up to now been hesitant to apply predictive modeling techniques and workflows. In this paper, we introduce to a machine learning (ML) approach to quantitative analysis geared towards optimizing the predictive performance, contrasting it with standard practices inferential statistics which focus on producing good parameter estimates. We discuss the potential synergies between the two fields against the backdrop of this at first glance, target-incompatibility. We discuss fundamental concepts in predictive modeling, such as out-of-sample model validation, variable and model selection, generalization and hyperparameter tuning procedures. Providing a hands-on predictive modelling for an quantitative social science audience, while aiming at demystifying computer science jargon. We use the example of high-quality patent identification guiding the reader through various model classes and procedures for data preprocessing, modelling and validation. We start of with more familiar easy to interpret model classes (Logit and Elastic Nets), continues with less familiar non-parametric approaches (Classification Trees and Random Forest) and finally presents artificial neural network architectures, first a simple feed-forward and then a deep autoencoder geared towards anomaly detection. Instead of limiting ourselves to the introduction of standard ML techniques, we also present state-of-the-art yet approachable techniques from artificial neural networks and deep learning to predict rare phenomena of interest. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aguinis, H., Pierce, C.A., Bosco, F.A., Muslin, I.S., First decade of organizational research methods: Trends in design, measurement, and data-analysis topics (2009) Organ.

The study also examined the relationship between memorable halal food experiences and place attachment. Design/methodology/approach: During the first week of August 2021, an online survey was used for data collection and shared on Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk) as well as sent to non-Muslim people known to the authors to have had halal food experiences in a tourism setting. A total of 293 valid responses were obtained. Findings: The results revealed that novelty seeking, authenticity, experience co-creation, substantive staging of the servicescape, togetherness and sensory appeal influence memorable halal food experiences. Furthermore, these experiences positively impact place attachment. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies to explore non-Muslim tourists’ memorable halal food experiences. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Halal; Halal food; Memorable halal food experience; Non-Muslim tourists; Place attachment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akhtar, N., Sun, J., Ahmad, W., Akhtar, M.N., The effect of non-verbal messages on Muslim tourists’ interaction adaptation: a case study of halal restaurants in China (2019) Journal of Destination Marketing and Management, 11, pp. 10-22; Akın, M.S., Okumuş, A., Shaping the consumers’ attitudes towards halal food products in Turkey (2020) Journal of Islamic Marketing, , doi:, (ahead-of-print; Ali, M.H., Chung, L., Kumar, A., Zailani, S., Tan, K.H., A sustainable blockchain framework for the halal food supply chain: lessons from Malaysia (2021) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 170, p. 120870; Al-Shami, H.A., Abdullah, S., Halal food industry certification and operation challenges and manufacturing execution system opportunities.

Unfortunately, there is no agreed method by which governments can differentiate between entrepreneurs and target them with the appropriate promotion policies. Thus, despite the good intentions, entrepreneurship policy initiatives have been incorrectly targeted, poorly implemented, and without the desired results, since different entrepreneurs may require different forms of assistance. Some scholars have suggested that without a context-specific classificatory guide, policymakers are unlikely to be accurate in their assessment of the growth capabilities of prospective candidates for specific promotion initiatives and this can explain some of the policy failures. This observation has motivated the present paper. Our objective is to provide a framework that helps identify the different contextual dimensions influencing formal and informal enterprise creation processes in SSA. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Africa; Entrepreneurship; Formal and Informal Entrepreneurship; Integrative Framework",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abor, J., Debt policy and performance of SMEs: Evidence from Ghanaian and South African firms (2007) The Journal of Risk Finance, 8 (4), pp. 364-379; (2017) Entrepreneurship and Industrialisation, , African Development Bank, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, United Nations Development Programme; Afutu-Kotey, R.L., Gough, K.W., Owusu, G., Young entrepreneurs in the mobile telephony sector in Ghana: From necessities to aspirations (2017) Journal of African Business, 18 (4), pp. 476-491; Almodóvar-González, M., Fernández-Portillo, A., Díaz-Casero, J.C., Entrepreneurial activity and economic growth.

The analysis focuses on similarities and deviations of BM configurations among 80 companies operating in the industry sector related to Phantom Limb Pain (PLP). Leveraging a questionnaire-based mapping tool, the results show that companies operating within the area of PLP treatment apply relatively similar BM configurations. This indicates that companies mostly imitate the successful BMs of their main competitors in the industry as a whole and in their specific sub-groups, thus potentially ignoring the opportunity to also compete on a BM level. The contribution brought by the paper is twofold. First, it adds to the research stream on BM configurations by showing that this concept can be used not only to analyze and foster cross-industry BM imitation, but also to explore and examine intra-industry BM imitation (or differentiation). Second, the article contributes to the research stream on intra-industry BM imitation by going beyond prior anecdotal evidence and empirically testing the existence of the phenomenon of intra-industry BM imitation and hence, the potential innovation space on a BM level. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","business model configurations; Business model imitation; business model innovation; value drivers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amit, R., Zott, C., Value Creation in e-Business (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (6), pp. 493-520; Benaquisto, L., Coding Frame (2008) The SAGE Encyclopedia of Qualitative Research Methods, pp. 89-90. , Given L., (ed), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications,. edited by; Bowen, G.A., Document Analysis as a Qualitative Research Method (2009) Qualitative Research Journal, 9 (2), pp. 27-40; Casadesus-Masanell, R., Zhu, F., Business Model Innovation and Competitive Imitation: The Case of Sponsor-Based Business Models (2013) Strategic Management Journal, 34, pp. 464-482; Chen, M.J., MacMillan, I.C., Nonresponse and Delayed Response to Competitive Moves: The Roles of Competitor Dependence and Action Irreversibility (1992) Academy of Management Journal, 35 (3), pp. 539-570; Chesbrough, H., Rosenbloom, R.S., The Role of the Business Model in Capturing Value from Innovation: Evidence from XEROX Corporation’s Technology Spinoff Companies (2002) Industrial and Corporate Change, 11 (3), pp. 529-555; DiMaggio, P., Powell, W., The Iron Cage Revisited: Institutional Isomorphism and Collective Rationality in Organizational Fields (1983) American Sociological Review, 48 (2), pp. 147-160; Enkel, E., Gassmann, O., Creative Imitation: Exploring the Case of Cross-Industry Innovation (2010) R&D Management, 40 (3), pp. 256-270; Enkel, E., Mezger, F., Imitation Processes and Their Application for Business Model Innovation: An Explorative Study (2013) International Journal of Innovation Management, 17 (1), p. 1340005; Ferreira, A., Otley, D., The Design and use of Performance Management Systems: An Extended Framework for Analysis (2009) Management Accounting Research, 20 (4), pp. 263-282; Frankenberger, K., Stam, W., Entrepreneurial Copycats: A Resource Orchestration Perspective on the Link Between Extra-Industry Business Model Imitation and new Venture Growth (2020) Long Range Planning, 53 (4), p. 101872; Garcia-Pont, C., Nohria, N., Local Versus Global Mimetism: The Dynamics of Alliance Formation in the Automobile Industry (2002) Strategic Management Journal, 23 (4), pp. 307-321; Garcia, R., Calantone, R., A Critical Look at Technological Innovation Typology and Innovativeness Terminology: A Literature Review (2002) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 19 (2), pp. 110-132; Gassmann, O., Frankenberger, K., Csik, M., (2014) The Business Model Navigator, , Harlow: Pearson; Gassmann, O., Zeschky, M., Opening up the Solution Space: The Role of Analogical Thinking for Breakthrough Product Innovation (2008) Creativity and Innovation Management, 17 (2), pp. 97-106; Greve, H.R., Managerial Cognition and the Mimetic Adoption of Market Positions: What you see is What you do (1998) Strategic Management Journal, 19 (10), pp. 967-988; Haveman, H.A., Follow the Leader: Mimetic Isomorphism and Entry Into new Markets (1993) Administrative Science Quarterly, 38, pp. 593-627; Holtström, J., Business Model Innovation Under Strategic Transformation (2021) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, pp. 1-13; Johnson, M.W., (2010) Seizing the White Space: Business Model Innovation for Growth and Renewal”, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Kim, I.H.S., Ku, T.Y.D., Lee, B.Y.M., Business Model Schema: Business Model Innovation Tool Based on Direct Causal Mechanisms of Profit (2020) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 32 (4), pp. 379-396; Kim, W.C., Mauborgne, R.A., (2014) Blue Ocean Strategy, Expanded Edition: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business Review Press; Krippendorff, K., (2004) Content Analysis An Introduction Its Methodology, , London: Sage Publications; Lambert, S.C., Davidson, R.A., Applications of the Business Model in Studies of Enterprise Success, Innovation and Classification: An Analysis of Empirical Research from 1996 to 2010 (2013) European Management Journal, 31 (6), pp. 668-681; Lieberman, M.B., Asaba, S., Why do Firms Imitate Each Other?

Design/methodology/approach: The authors undertake a conceptual analysis and present an enhanced framework of absorptive capacity by integrating multiple literature streams. The authors have analysed the most relevant literature to provide underlying justifications for the proposed conceptual model. Findings: Absorptive capacity ensures the long-term survival and success of a business. To develop absorptive capacity successfully, firms should focus on its various dimensions and existing intangible assets and external environment. The multidimensionality and richness of absorptive capacity is an under-explored area in the existing literature. The authors revisit the conceptualisation of absorptive capacity and add environmental conditions and the internationalisation process to the original conceptualisation. Absorptive capacity does not lead to a competitive advantage independent of its environment. To successfully develop it, firms have to adopt a holistic approach by considering the multi-dimensions, drivers and contextual conditions of absorptive capacity. Originality/value: This study contributes by conceptualising absorptive capacity as a dynamic capability. It is one of the first studies to specifically propose a framework that combines antecedents (prior knowledge, combinative capabilities and IT capabilities), moderators (environmental conditions, namely, market and technological turbulence, competitiveness and the internationalisation process) and consequences (competitive advantage). The study offers a unique conceptualisation with implications for researchers and managers. As a result, managers will have a well-defined blueprint to create value by using firm capabilities. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Combinative capabilities; Environmental conditions; Information-Technology capabilities; Multidimensionality; Potential absorptive capacity; Prior related knowledge; Realised absorptive capacity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adams, R., Jeanrenaud, S., Bessant, J., Denyer, D., Overy, P., Sustainability-oriented innovation: a systematic review (2016) International Journal of Management Reviews, 18 (2), pp. 180-205; Adler, P.S., Kwon, S., Social capital: prospects for a new concept (2002) Academy of Management Review, 27 (1), pp. 17-40; Adler, P.S., Goldoftas, B., Levine, D.I., Flexibility versus efficiency?

The sector indices are self-constructed utilizing daily data of 258 unique stocks listed in eight sectors from January 2005 to September 2018 that permits implementing the same methodological framework across two markets. The study applies the VAR-GARCH model that enables to study bidirectional spillover effects. The results provide evidence of volatility spillovers between petroleum prices and sector indices. The effects are more apparent in the case of the net exporter, where the bidirectional volatility transmissions were observed. The computed optimal portfolio weights and hedge ratios considerably vary among sectors of both countries. The findings emphasize the crucial role of comprehending the heterogeneity of sectors for the management of investment portfolios. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","hedge ratios;

Based on a case study of a large wind power project in Kenya, this research explores technology transfer and interactive learning processes to accumulate local capabilities. The study emphasizes the multiplicity of actors involved in complex infrastructure projects and explores the nature of their relationships and interactions through the research question: What are the opportunities and limitations for local learning and capability building through technology transfer in large renewable energy infrastructure projects? Identifying interactions across multiple phases of the Lake Turkana Wind Power project, the results show that multiple loops of interactions foster better local-learning opportunities.

Analyzing data from 1,203 participants of online brand communities, we find that consumers who seek to be popular and attractive are more likely to engage in CBC, while those who seek to affiliate with close others and help the community are less likely to do so. Consumers who identify with and are loyal to a particular brand are more likely to engage in CBC. Taken together, our study moves us toward a systematic analysis of the relationship between brands and cyberbullying on social media. © 2021 The Author(s).

Changes to an MC element such as a performance measurement system, however, may in turn create incoherence with other, non-changed elements, generating a need for more changes, and thus trigger a cascade effect. To date, however, we know little about how this sequential process unfolds and what managers can do to deal with incoherence. This paper contributes by enhancing the understanding of sequential changes, drawing on the organizational ecology literature, and we empirically inform our research with a five-year longitudinal case study. Our data illustrates in detail how initial MC changes, intended to cope with an environmental shift, trigger a cascade effect. This sequential process results in an extensive change period, during which various incoherent MC elements coexist. Our study acknowledges that incoherence among MC elements can decrease control effectiveness by creating intra-organizational frictions, yet we highlight the role of managers in mitigating such negative effects. Specifically, we show how managers can alleviate the unfavorable effects of incoherence by changing their use of performance measures in order to better facilitate organizational dialogue, learning and problem solving. © 2020 European Accounting Association.","Change; Management Control; Organizational Ecology; Performance Measurement",,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank Salvador Carmona, Matthew Hall, Robin Roslender, Thomas Borup Kristensen and Henrik Nielsen, for their constructive comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Therefore, this paper suggests an initial framework for understanding and discussing collaborative constellations and co-creative processes in museum experience design, by presenting a Venn diagram.

Some empirical studies suggest that subsidy policies can play a positive role. This study addresses two key questions that follow from this observation: first, if the intensity of a subsidy policy is increased, can it play a greater role in strengthening the stability of cooperation between firms? Second, what other factors play a mediating role in this effect? Utilizing a dynamic game model, this paper analyses influential factors such as absorptive capacity, frequency of engagement and technical value on cooperative stability, and investigates the role of innovation policy in the process of cooperation through a random number-driven simulation. The findings indicate that only when the absorption capacity and technological value of both partners meet a certain threshold is the probability of positive cooperative behavior improved. Otherwise, increased subsidies tend to foster negative cooperative behavior instead. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we present the findings from a qualitative meta-analysis of literature-based accounts of chefs' creative leadership practices from the context of haute cuisine. We bring together both the leader-chefs' and academic authors' understandings of practices available in scholarly papers to achieve a credible picture of creative leadership practices in haute cuisine. We present our findings as a meta-vignette introducing nine prototypical characters representing patterns of practices that leader-chefs perform as they are fostering creativity. We further demonstrate when and how leader-chefs employ practices that are more typical of facilitating and integrating contexts. The nine characters afford an immediate intuitive understanding of the creative leadership practices in haute cuisine, helping scholars to look for and analyse creative leadership and support creative leaders to understand better and be more mindful of their practices. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","creative leadership; creativity; haute cuisine; practices; qualitative meta-analysis",,,,,,"Velux Fonden","We would like to thank the participants of the 20th International CINet Conference and our colleagues from imagine … Centre for Creative Industries and Institutions at Copenhagen Business School for their valuable feedback on an earlier version of this paper.

This is an empirical study based on 113 surveys of managers/entrepreneurs from the Estonian IT sector. The questionnaire was uploaded onto the online platform of connect.ee and the participants were invited to complete it. The study reveals that only conscientiousness positively and significantly predicts causation logic. However, four of the five factors of personality traits positively and significantly predict effectuation logic, i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, except for neuroticism. Furthermore, only nine of 25 hypotheses are positive and significant, and of the 11 relationships of the model, three are negative and non-significant for causation logic and eight are negative and non-significant for effectuation logic. Finally, there are another five relationships of the model which are positively but non-significantly related. Managers of IT companies in Estonia should think of shifting to effectuation logic as most personality traits predict effectuation logic, and therefore, there is the possibility of a better performance for IT firms. Eight of the 51 items of the model had standardised regression weights below the threshold of 0.500, but only four were extracted from the final model. The extraction of items from the model indicates the need for the re-identification of the constructs of personality traits using, for example, the six-factor personality traits. © 2021 by the authors.

Fruitful implementation of CTNs will leverage environmental and socio-economic goals of sustainable development in the freight transport sector. The benefits of CTNs in horizontal collaborative settings have been widely demonstrated through several modelling approaches. However, in practice, the real applications of CTNs have been challenging and most did not achieve satisfactory performances. Some studies have addressed this issue by identifying different barriers to CTN implementation. However, a conceptual framework for the barriers is not well-established. In addition, the literature lacks a decision-making framework for the CTN implementation which considers the different barriers. To address this gap, this paper conducted a literature review of the barriers to CTN implementation. In total, 31 different barriers were identified. A conceptual barrier framework is developed by grouping the 31 barriers into five categories: the business model, information sharing, the human factors, the Collaborative Decision Support Systems (CDSSs), and the market. The paper additionally proposes a stage-gate model integrating the conceptual barrier framework into the CTN implementation decision-making process. The current work contributes to the existing literature by developing both theoretical and practical understandings of the barriers to implementing CTNs and will support decision makers in CTN implementation to maximize the CTN benefits and minimize the risk of CTN failure. © 2021, The Author(s).","Barriers; Decision-making; Freight; Horizontal collaboration; Real application; Stage-gate model; Transport","Decision making; Decision support systems; Sustainable development; Collaborative decisions; Collaborative settings; Conceptual frameworks; Decision making process; Decision-making frameworks; Information sharing; Literature reviews; Transport networks; Freight transportation",,,,,,"This research was done as part of the DiRECTLY project (6156-00001B) funded by Innovation Fund Denmarks Grand Solution scheme.

We applied time-varying Hurst exponent during the liberalization period and tested Adaptive Market Hypothesis. The results confirm the role of foreign investors in improving the local market’s efficiency, however, the findings show that the liberalization does not always result in the increase of foreign participation, which then has a limited impact on the efficiency. The study also indicates the importance of governance policies, along with liberalization policies, in completing market structure and market dynamics, that promote equity price reflects truly firm’s intrinsic value. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Foreign investment; Frontier markets; Hurst exponent; Liberalization; Market efficiency; Vietnam",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aloui, C., Hurst's exponent behaviour, weak-form stock market efficiency and financial liberalization: The Tunisian case (2011) Economics Bulletin, 31 (1), pp. 830-843; Aymen, B.R., Financial liberalization and stock market efficiency: New evidence from emerging economies (2013) Emerging markets review, 17, pp. 186-208; Bae, K.H., The cost of stock market integration in emerging markets (2015) Asia-Pacific Journal of Financial Studies, 44 (1), pp. 1-23; Baele, L., Volatility spillover effects in European equity markets (2005) Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 40, pp. 373-402; Bai, J., Perron, P., Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes (1998) Econometrica, 66, pp. 47-48; Batten, J., Foreign ownership in emerging stock markets (2015) Journal of Multinational Financial Management, 32-33, pp. 15-24; Bekaert, G.H., Dating the integration of world equity markets (2002) Journal of Financial Economics, 65, pp. 203-247; Cajueiro, D.O., Does financial market liberalization increase the degree of market efficiency?

Popular and academic discourse often focuses on grandparents as indulgent feeders with negative implications for children’s weight and eating practices. Drawing on the concept of family identity bundles and interviews with Danish and New Zealand grandparents and grandchildren, it was found that, for both generations, being alone together was a treat in itself and a time for treats, although they were fluent in the discourse of balance and moderation. Grandparents’ food-related practices were shaped by the internalized as well as actual presence of the parents, but they tended to experience rather than express tensions over parental feeding practices. These findings offer a nuanced account of grandparents’ role in children’s (un)healthy eating practices and of the role of food in intergenerational family relationships. © The Author(s) 2021.","children;

New innovative technologies can support farmers in a more targeted planning of fertilizer application and crop management at the field level to increase the effect of measures when reducing nitrogen losses. However, if farmers do not perceive the need for such a concept, the demand (market pull) will be minimal, making the implementation of such a technology difficult. The lack of this market pull could, however, be counterbalanced by a market push from research or requirements from public sector stakeholders (regulators). Within this domain, the main objective of this paper was to study technological change over time and identify and understand the crucial stakeholder involvement using the Functions of Innovation Systems Approach. This article shows how stakeholders’ perceptions and participation evolved over a 10-year period. It examines the interplay between technology readiness and the perceived readiness and acceptance by affected stakeholders. We demonstrate how stakeholder engagement was crucial to ensure the development of the technologies by creating marketable options for their future implementation. A key dynamic that emerged in this process was the transition from a research push to a regulator pull. We demonstrate the fact that without the regulatory requirement linked to changes towards more targeting of measures, the technology would not, on its own, be a business case, although it would provide new knowledge, thus representing a gain for society. The specific findings can be used in countries where new technologies need to be developed, and where a link to the regulation can ensure the active use of the new technology and, therefore, make their implementation worthwhile. © 2021 by the authors.

R&D subsidized loans (tiexi daikuan) is an effective market-driven solution to promote firms’ R&D outputs, including patent applications and new product sales, in China. However, empirical examination on the effects of subsidized loans is insufficient. Using a panel data of manufacturing firms of Jiangsu Province from 2010 to 2014, the study investigates the effects of R&D subsidized loans on firms’ R&D outputs in comparison to that of the direct R&D grants. The results show that R&D subsidized loan recipients significantly outperform those who only receive direct grants in terms of new product sales. Meanwhile, subsidized loans inhibit the recipients’ exploratory patent applications and discourage R&D activities with higher risks. This study contributes to R&D subsidy literature and extends the knowledge in the roles of different types of public sponsorships on firms’ innovation. © 2021 The Author(s).

This paper investigates the service value co-creation processes in the digital platform context and recognizes the service value output categories under different stages among platform business, platform buyers, and sellers. Using an emergent and representative digital platform, the Xianyu idle trading platform, and adopting an embedded case study design and social media analysis approach, this paper illustrates the service value co-creation practices and value categories among users in each stage of purchase. We find that platform business not only facilitates value co-creations but is also an active participant. This study contributes to both value co-creation and platform business literature, and it sheds light on achieving sustainability in the platform economy and moving toward an environmentally friendly society. © 2021 by the authors.

Adopting the Difference-in-Difference (DID) model, we find that: 1) China’s ETS pilot policy can significantly improve the carbon emission performance of listed companies in the pilot provinces. 2) The heterogeneity analysis shows that the carbon emission performance of listed companies in the eastern coastal pilot areas has improved significantly, which is not significant in the central and western pilot areas. 3) We find that China’s ETS pilot policy can significantly improve innovation capabilities of listed companies, suggesting that innovation is a channel for the impact of the China’s ETS pilot policy on carbon emission performance in the pilot provinces. Overall, our study shows that ETS pilot policy has played a governance role in China and improved carbon emission performance. We further highlight some important policy implications with respect to helping companies save energy and reduce emissions, and promoting the further improvement of China’s ETS pilot policy. © Copyright © 2021 Zheng, Sun, Zhang, Wang and Mao.","carbon emission intensity; carbon emission performance; China; corporate innovation; difference-in-difference (DID); emission trading scheme (ETS)","Carbon; Commerce; Emission control; Carbon emission intensities; Carbon emission performance; Carbon emissions; China; Corporate innovation; Difference-in-difference; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; Emission trading scheme; Emissions performance; Emissions Trading Scheme; Public policy",,,,,"19GLB015; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71902006; Beijing Municipal Commission of Education: SM202010011007; Beijing Technology and Business University, BTBU; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities: 2018100123","We acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71902006), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China (Grant No. 2018100123), the Municipal Social Science Fund of Beijing (Grant No. 19GLB015), and the Scientific Research Program of Beijing Municipal Education Commission (Grant No. SM202010011007).",,,,,,,,,,"Abrell, J., Faye, A.N., Zachman, G., Assessing the impact of the EU ETS using firm level data (2011) Working Papers of BETA, , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254454774, in; Al-Mulali, U., Weng-Wai, C., Sheau-Ting, L., Mohammed, A.H., Investigating the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis by utilizing the ecological footprint as an indicator of environmental degradation (2015) Ecol.

A hybrid electricity/hydrogen/gas/refueling station (EHGRS) powered by renewable energy in an off-grid region is proposed. It supplies electricity for electric vehicles (EVs), and hydrogen for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) and produces natural gas for natural gas vehicles (NGVs) simultaneously. A hybrid stochastic/information gap decision theory (IGDT) optimization method is employed for the scheduling problem of the hybrid EHGRS in an uncertain environment. The uncertainties of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power is modelled via scenarios, while the uncertainties of the demands of EVs, HFCVs and NGVs, depending on human behavior, are formulated with a bi-level IGDT method without knowing the accurate distribution information. The work aims to find the maximum expected profits of the hybrid EHGRS. Two different scheduling strategies, i.e. risk-averse and risk-seeker, with two contradictory attitudes under the uncertain demands are proposed. Results indicate that 1) The proposed hybrid EHGRS can simultaneously provide different fuels to EVs, HFCVs and NGVs. 2) Under the same condition, the profit for the risk-averse scheduling is decreased and the risk-seeker scheduling is increased, compared to the results obtained by the pure stochastic optimization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Hybrid electricity/hydrogen/gas/ refueling station; Information gap decision theory; Renewable energy; Scheduling; Stochastic optimization","Behavioral research; Decision theory; Electric power transmission networks; Fuel cells; Optimization; Profitability; Sustainable development; Vehicle-to-grid; Hybrid electricity/hydrogen/gas/ refueling station; Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; Hydrogen gas; Information gap decision theory; Information-gap; Off-grids; Renewable energies; Risk averse; Stochastic optimizations; Uncertainty; Scheduling",,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2018YFE0127600","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2018YFE0127600 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Cost assessment of hydrogen production from PV and electrolysis, (2016), https://arena.gov.au/assets/2016/05/Assessment-of-the-cost-of-hydrogen-from-PV.pdf, Accessed (Accessed 11 May 2021); Abapour, S., Mohammadi-Ivatloo, B., Hagh, M.T., Robust bidding strategy for demand response aggregators in electricity market based on game theory (2020) J.

The theory of enabling formalization is applied to gauge and understand the extent to which organizational members perceive performance measures, such as key performance indicators (KPIs), as enabling (i.e. as a vehicle creating continuous improvement). We empirically confirm a positive relation between changing the context of performance measures and the perceived level of enabling use of KPIs by applying a difference-in-differences test. We also show that the increase in perceptions of the enabling use of KPIs is associated with improved perceived performance (e.g. time consumption, quality). We measure the perceived enabling use using data gathered from questionnaires distributed over several rounds in both the department implementing lean principles and a non-affected control department. As such, our study involves a longitudinal, quasi-natural experiment. We confirm the statistical results through interviews, observations, and internal documents from the case company. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Continuous improvement; Enabling formalization; Lean; Longitudinal natural experiment; Performance measurement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.S., Building better bureaucracies (1999) Academy of Management Executive, 13 (4), pp. 36-49; Adler, P.S., Benner, M., Brunner, D.J., MacDuffie, J.P., Osono, E., Staats, B.R., Winter, S.G., Perspectives on productivity dilemma (2009) Journal of Operations Management, 27, pp. 99-113; Adler, P.S., Borys, B., Two types of bureaucracy: Enabling or coercive (1996) Administrative Science Quarterly, 41, pp. 61-89; Adler, P.S., Goldoftas, B., Levine, D.I., Flexibility versus efficiency?

In this article, we address the question: do stylized trajectories emerge from the analysis of countries' relative innovative capacity (IC) and GVC participation? We draw explorative insights from a cluster analysis of 45 countries on the two subsectors of the information technology industry: hardware and software. Our analysis uncovers remarkable differences between hardware and software and across countries. We identify different trajectories and discuss the sectoral specificities that contribute explaining their existence. The association between the strengthening of IC and a deeper insertion in GVCs applies only to a handful of countries and only in the software subsector. The specificity of this association raises questions for future research on innovation trajectories in GVCs. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.",,"cluster analysis; hardware; industrial production; information technology; innovation; software; trajectory",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Altenburg, T., Schmitz, H., Stamm, A., Breakthrough?

It compares the differential game equilibrium solutions under centralized and decentralized decision-making. The green supply chain members are coordinated through the dynamic wholesale price mechanism, and numerical simulation is used as a methodology, to verify and explain the results. The study found that compared to decentralized decision-making, the level of green technology and the total profit of green channels are higher under centralized decision-making. When the coordination parameters are within a certain range, the dynamic wholesale price mechanism can coordinate the behavior of manufacturers and retailers. The result also discovers that under the dynamic wholesale price mechanism, with the increase of investment cost coefficient, or the increase of price sensitivity or the decrease of consumer's environmental awareness, the green technology level, product green degree, price, retailer's profit, and the total profit of green channel is decreased. In contrast, the wholesale price and manufacturer's profits are increased. © 2021 The Author(s)","Differential game; Dynamic wholesale price; Green supply chain; Green technology research",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ali, Q., Salman, A., Yaacob, H., Zaini, Z., Abdullah, R., Does big data analytics enhance sustainability and financial performance?

Today, a multiplicity of entrepreneurial approaches exists, cf. skunk work, bricolage, bootlegging. However, these exists in disparate literature, that provides limited oversight to managers in, that need to select between a manifold of different entrepreneurial strategies. Moreover, these approaches typically originate from a distinctively different organizational context, namely SMEs. Through a literature review we identify two important axiomatic assumptions concerning entrepreneurial strategies within the organizational conditions of MNCs. The first fundamental assumption concerns the organizational origin of such effort. The second theoretical assumption deals with how the entrepreneurial initiative can meet either organizational resistance or support. We synthesize these two dimensions into a two-by-two matrix, that provides an answer to our research question: what are the critical dimensions for entrepreneurial strategies in an MNC context? We then employ this typology to categorize predominant entrepreneurial strategies in current literature, to create a overview that can be used both for structuring the debate in the literature; as well as a basis to discuss important implicit assumptions, that should guide the selection of entrepreneurial strategy in a MNC context in practice. © The Author(s) 2020.","bootlegging; bricolage; guided evolution; intrapreneurship; MNC; skunk works",,,,,,,"The author wishes to thank DI.

Though the existing literature has suggested fiscal decentralization strategies between different local government levels, few of the studies ascertain garbage classification efficiency from a quantitative perspective. To bridge the gap, this study examines the optimal fiscal decentralization strategies for garbage classification. It uses an optimization model while considering decision makers’ requirements regarding the fund allocation amounts at different government levels and the classification ratios in villages as constraints and decisions, respectively. A three-stage heuristic algorithm is applied to determine optimal landfill locations and efficient classification ratios for the garbage processing system in rural China, with an analytical discussion on the propositions and properties of the model. Our analytical results suggest that 1) the theoretically optimal solution is conditionally achievable, 2) the applied algorithm can achieve the optimal solution faster when the relationship between governance costs and classification ratios reaches some mathematical conditions, and 3) there is always a potential for increasing the retained funds between different government levels or for reducing the total appropriation from the county government. The numerical experiment on a primary dataset from 12 towns and 143 villages in the Pingyuan county of Guangdong province, China, does not only affirm the qualitative results, but it also provides insights into the difficulties encountered during the implementation of the garbage classification policy in China’s rural areas. © Copyright © 2021 Ma, Huang, Li, Hu, P.

After a brief outline of the existing EU legislation on accounting and a discussion on whether accounting law is part of company law, some examples of accounting concepts in company law – i.e. examples of accounting concepts that have been ‘implemented’ in company law – are discussed, drawing on the Consolidated Company Law Directive (CCLD) and the Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD 2) as well as the International Accounting Standards (IAS) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These examples are related party transactions, consideration other than in cash and fair value, serious loss of the subscribed capital as well as a few other examples. It is also discussed whether accounting concepts in company law are a ‘good’ or a ‘bad’ thing. Balancing the pros and cons, in the author’s opinion, it is mostly positive that accounting concepts are used in company law in areas where this makes sense – and hence, in the author’s opinion, accounting concepts in company law are mainly a ‘good’ thing. © 2021 De Gruyter.

Drawing on the theoretical lenses of service-dominant logic, service design and institutional theory, we investigate how and why the dark side manifests itself in B2B relationships between service co-creating actors in professional service settings. Additionally, we propose how these problems can be avoided. The study takes place in an international environment. It employs an in-depth single embedded case study of the relationship between a German creative agency and a German industrial client operating in China. Our work chronicles how their relationship developed over time, eventually resulting in a breakdown. The findings captured in the framework highlight an array of contributing factors. Propositions are made on how a more stable and robust agency–client relationship can be built and the dark side of B2B relationships defeated. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Case study; Dark side of business-to-business relationships; Institutions; Interface; Professional services; Service design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abosag, I., Lee, J.-W., The formation of trust and commitment in business relationships in the Middle East: Understanding Et-Moone relationships (2013) International Business Review, 22 (3), pp. 602-614; Abosag, I., Yen, D.A., Barnes, B.R., What is dark about the dark-side of business relationships?

It draws on two harmonised European surveys, one addressed to employers and the other addressed to employees. The analysis shows that adopting a ‘learning organisation’ design is associated with better innovation performance and that learning forms of work organisation are associated with more satisfied, less stressed workers. The chapter concludes by arguing that the Danish national innovation system would benefit from the introduction of policies designed to support the adoption of learning organisations. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alasoini, T., In search of generative results: A new generation of programmes to develop work organization (2006) Economic and Industrial Democracy, 27 (1), pp. 9-37; Alasoini, T., Strategies to promote workplace innovation: A comparative analysis of nine national and regional approaches (2009) Economic and Industrial Democracy, 30 (4), pp. 614-642; Alasoini, T., (2019) The Promotion of Workplace Innovation in Finland: Policy Developments and Outlook for the Future, , Report to the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health.

The design of entrepreneurship policies has been debated extensively. In formulating policies, one of the major questions that emerges is whether policies should promote the entry of more entrepreneurs into the market, and if yes, which type of entry should be promoted, and how can it be implemented? On the one hand, excess entry can lead to a significant waste of resources because the majority of new entrepreneurs fail within a short period, and very few achieve the societal goal of high growth and job creation. On the other hand, focusing on promoting only attractive entrepreneurs, from society’s point of view, might be an impossible exercise. Recently a different rationale for entrepreneurship policy has been suggested, arguing that entrepreneurship is largely about experimentation, where ideas are carried from firm to firm by individuals, despite failures along the way. This chapter discusses these policy directions, reviews the recent literature and points to the future direction of entrepreneurship policy. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acs, Z.J., Audretsch, D.B., Lehmann, E.E., Licht, G., National system of entrepreneurship (2016) Small Business Economics, 46 (4), pp. 527-535; Acs, Z.J., Autio, E., Szerb, L., National systems of entrepreneurship: Measurement issues and policy implications (2014) Research Policy, 43 (3), pp. 476-494; Adner, R., (2012) The wide lens: A new strategy for innovation, , Penguin UK; Aldrich, H.E., Zimmer, C., Entrepreneurship through social networks (1986) The art and science of entrepreneurship, pp. 3-23. , Ballinger, Cambridge, MA; Baumol, W.J., (2010) The microtheory of innovative entrepreneurship, , Princeton University Press; Bhidé, A., (2000) The origin and evolution of new businesses, , Oxford University Press; Birch, D.G., (1979) The job generation process, , MIT Program on Neighborhood and Regional Change; Brüderl, J., Preisendörfer, P., Network support and the success of newly founded business (1998) Small Business Economics, 10 (3), pp. 213-225; Bruton, G.D., Ahlstrom, D., Li, H.-L., Institutional theory and entrepreneurship: Where are we now and where do wo need to move in the future?

The first describes the evolving characteristics of the Danish system of research and innovation with special attention to the role of policy at the national and regional levels. The second part focuses on interorganisational relations, including the position of Danish firms in national and global value chains. The third part examines changes in labour markets and in the educational and training system, and it considers the impact of new technologies including robotics and artificial intelligence on employment and skills. The fourth part turns to issues of climate change and environmental sustainability including an assessment of the Danish economy’s success in meeting the challenges of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The book will be of particular interest to small countries, of which the Danish innovation system is representative, but it also appeals more broadly to an audience interested in innovation systems and policies to support economic development. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,,,,,9781000368727; 9780367480479,,,"English","Globalisation, New and Emerg.

The analysis goes deeper into the effects of robotics and AI/ML for individual workers than previous studies and has policy implications for the performance of the Danish national system of innovation by identifying sectors and occupations that could potentially benefit from increased investments in training for skills development. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acemoğlu, D., Restrepo, P., The race between man and machine: Implications of technology for growth, factor shares, and employment (2018) American Economic Review, 108 (6), pp. 1488-1542; Autor, D.H., Levy, F., Murnane, R.J., The skill content of recent technological change: An empirical exploration (2003) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118, pp. 1279-1333; Brynjolfsson, E., McAfee, A., Will humans go the way of horses?

We document recent changes in the Danish labour market, and we argue that labour market policy needs to be for the employed as well as the unemployed, the latter are the traditional target of labour market policy. We highlight this policy need by referring instead to ‘work policy’, and we focus on how such policy can future-proof the competence development of the workforce. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acemoglu, D., Restrepo, P., (2017) Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labour Markets, , NBER Working Paper, (w23285); Acemoglu, D., Restrepo, P., The race between man and machine: Implications of technology for growth, factor shares, and employment (2018) American Economic Review, 108 (6), pp. 1488-1542; (2009) Velfærd Kræver Arbejde, Arbejdsmarkedskommissionens anbefalinger - Analyserapport, , http://www.amkom.dk, Copenhagen; Arntz, M., Gregory, T., Zierahn, U., (2016) The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries: A Comparative Analysis, , OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers.

Using the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and related targets as overall performance measures for sustainable development the Danish innovation system is performing relatively well but still with major challenges before the 2030 targets are achieved - especially in relation to sustainable cities, consumption, production, climate action and ‘life below water’. It is argued that although the 17 SDGs may serve as important signposts and wake-up calls for policy action, the notion of the learning economy where learning and capability building are at the centre provides a relevant supplementary starting point for formulating policies for a transition to a more sustainable development path. The chapter turns finally to a wider perspective on sustainable development and raises the question of whether the meaning of sustainable development needs to be rethought in the Anthropocene era with significant human impact on the Earth’s ecosystem. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2020) Gør Verdensmål til Vores Mål - 197 danske målepunkter for en mere bæredygtig verden, , [in Danish], Vores Mål projektet.

In an international comparison, Denmark fares extremely well regarding the research performance. Likewise, Denmark is positioned as an innovative leader in Europe, and has been for several years. Even if the overall innovation performance appears superior by European standards, the numbers for innovation performance of firms call for attention, as negative development trends are observed. Based on the diagnosis of the system, we identify a challenge and four stepping stones for continued Danish innovation performance.

The chapter provides general information on the interplay between policymaking on the one hand, and societal development and understanding of innovation on the other. Specifically, it illustrates in detail the upsurge of innovation systems thinking in policymaking in Denmark and the forces behind this. We show that innovation policy instruments gradually evolved as a result of policy needs, changes in understanding innovation, business cycles and innovation policy development elsewhere. We find that there was a shift from fragmented policies towards a more integrated, systemic and holistic approach to policymaking from the mid- to late-1990s onwards. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arrow, K., Economic Welfare and the Allocation of Resources for Innovation (1962) The Rate and Direction of Inventive Activity, pp. 609-625. , ed.

The supplier types vary in their engagement with their most important customers, but not in performance. The interaction-oriented nature of the Danish innovation system is also reflected in the identified supplier types, and there are no signs of global competition and production relocation undermining this distinctive feature of the Danish system. The study concludes that the globalisation of manufacturing activities is not as great a challenge as might have been expected for Danish suppliers. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, P.H., Christensen, P.R., (1998) Den Globale Udfordring: Danske Underleverandørers Internationalisering, , Erhvervsministeriet: Erhvervsfremme Styrelsen; Andersen, P.H., Organizing international technological collaboration in subcontractor relationships: An investigation of the knowledge-stickiness problem (1999) Research Policy, 28 (6), pp. 625-642; Andersen, P.H., Drejer, I., Østergaard, C.R., Søberg, P.V., Wæhrens, B.V., Supplier value creation configurations in high-cost countries (2019) Journal of Global Operations and Strategic Sourcing, 12 (3), pp. 429-448; Bettis, R.A., Bradley, S.P., Hamel, G., Outsourcing and industrial decline (1992) Academy of Management Perspectives, 6 (1), pp. 7-22; Carlsson, B., Internationalization of innovation systems: A survey of the literature (2006) Research Policy, 35 (1), pp. 56-67; Christensen, J.L., Gregersen, B., Johnson, B., Lundvall, B., Tomlinson, M., An NSI in transition?

The reforms follow in the wake of a year-long debate on the relevance of the regional level for policies, which also includes a debate on which actors are relevant at different levels of aggregation. The policy reform of 2019 appears to centralise how business support is provided and also to possibly decouple some of the already established systemic links between actors. Although the new business promotion policy setup in Denmark does acknowledge that the decentralised business promotion effort should take its point of departure in local and regional growth challenges and framework conditions, there is a clear move towards simplification in organisation and actors, as well as in policy means. The precise, adequate configuration of the innovation system and its support infrastructure is difficult to determine ex ante and surely needs to be seen in a specific systemic context. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acs, Z.J., Autio, E., Szerb, L., National systems of entrepreneurship: Measurement issues and policy implications (2014) Research Policy, 43, pp. 476-494; Arnold, E., Evaluating research and innovation policy: A systems world needs systems evaluations (2004) Research Evaluation, 13 (1), pp. 3-17; Arrow, K.J., The economic implications of learning by doing (1962) The Review of Economic Studies, 29 (3), pp. 155-173; Asheim, B., Isaksen, A., Regional innovation systems: The integration of local ‘sticky’ and global ‘ubiquitous’ knowledge (2002) The Journal of Technology Transfer, 27 (1), pp. 77-86; Audretsch, D., Keilbach, M., Entrepreneurship and regional growth: An evolutionary interpretation (2004) Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 14 (5), pp. 605-616; Barca, F., (2009) An agenda for a reformed cohesion policy - A place-based approach to meeting European Union challenges and expectations, , Independent report prepared at the request of Danuta Hübner, Commissioner for Regional Policy; Bentley, G., Bailey, D., Shutt, J., From RDAs to LEPs: A new localism?

We find that the education and training system must be adapted if Danish firms are to lead in the green transition.

However, there is a need to increase our knowledge on innovation activity in the public sector. In this chapter, we provide insights on innovation in Danish public workplaces by exploring recent survey data. We present evidence on the overall activity levels and types of innovation. We focus on the extent of collaborative innovation between workplaces and firms, citizens, research institutions, etc. Results show that 80% of all types of innovations involve some kind of collaboration, a level similar to that of other Nordic countries.

We explore the 2008 financial crisis and hand-collect unique data on more than 2,700 vessel chartering deals closed in the container shipping industry from 2000 to 2011. Our contribution is twofold. We challenge the literature by finding that low and high status players use different collaborative strategies under uncertainty: the high status players are more prone to coopetition and the low status ones reach out to external buyers. We also extend the literature on social exchange and uncertainty and introduce other constructs: strategic versatility and country-level long-term orientation of the suppliers that we study in our model. Our findings are relevant for policy and managerial decision-makers in the industry. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Charter; Container shipping; Social exchange; Status; Uncertainty; Versatility",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aalbers, H.L., Dolfsma, W., Resilience of information flow during restructuring: Characterizing information value being exchanged and the structure of a network under turmoil (2019) Journal of Business Research, 100, pp. 299-310; Anwar, S.T., Global strategy gone astray: Maersk's big box boats and the world shipping industry (2020) Thunderbird International Business Review, 62, pp. 183-193; Aral, S., Van Alstyne, M., The diversity-bandwidth trade-off (2011) American Journal of Sociology, 117 (1), pp. 90-171; Beckman, C.M., Haunschild, P.R., Phillips, D.J., Friends or strangers?

However, with several additional interests and priorities relating to sustainability, the job of finding common ground in collaboration becomes more complex compared to conventional housing and neighborhood projects. Moreover, the type of stakeholders involved and the issues they are concerned with change as the project develops. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of empirical-based research found in the intersection between stakeholder collaboration and sustainable neighborhood projects. Our comprehensive systematic review of the past 20 years’ extant literature revealed 20 main themes impacting stakeholder collaboration spread over the stages of project development. Building on the various themes, we summarized several factors that support collaboration capacity in SN projects, and that can ultimately lead to different trajectories for sustainability outcomes over time. Furthermore, the review revealed several potential avenues for research, which may help improve our understanding of the mechanics and interaction of stakeholder involvement in SN projects. © 2021 The Author(s)","Project development; Stakeholder collaboration; Sustainable neighborhoods; Sustainable urban development; Systematic literature review","Sustainable development; Built environment; Carbon emissions; Conventional housing; Poor performance; Project development; Research agenda; Stakeholder involvement; Systematic Review; Energy utilization; literature review; neighborhood; project management; stakeholder; sustainable development; urban development",,,,,"Norges Forskningsråd: 257660","This article has been written within the Research Centre on Zero Emission Neighborhoods in Smart Cities (FME ZEN).

Under the multi-level institutional settings such as China, however, it is unclear in current literature as to whether central and local-level governmental R&D subsidy programs exert heterogeneous influences on recipient firms’ exploratory innovation. By employing an exclusive panel data of manufacturing firms in Jiangsu Province, this study investigates the heterogeneous effects of central and local R&D subsidies on firms’ exploratory innovation. Considering that regional innovation contexts may influence the learning and innovation of subsidy recipients, we further test the interaction effects of specialized industrial agglomeration and R&D subsidies. We find that R&D subsidies in general do promote firms’ exploratory innovation, and the local R&D subsidy exhibits a more salient effect. In addition, the positive effect of subsidies is stronger for the recipients in a highly specialized industrial agglomeration. This study contributes to R&D subsidy literature and extends our knowledge on the different roles of central and local governments in firms’ learning behaviors and technological upgrading. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","central and local governments; exploratory innovation; industrial agglomeration; public R&D subsidy","Engineering; Heterogeneous effects; Institutional setting; Interaction effect; Knowledge learning; Learning behavior; Manufacturing firms; Policy instruments; Regional innovation; Regional planning",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71932009; Aalborg Universitet, AAU: 760738; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation: 2018M641397","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71932009), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2018M641397) and Aalborg University Social Science Faculty Talent Program (No. 760738).",,,,,,,,,,"Abadie, A., Imbens, G.W., Matching on the Estimated Propensity Score (2016) Econometrica, 84 (2), pp. 781-807; Afcha, S., García-Quevedo, J., The impact of R&D subsidies on R&D employment composition (2016) Industrial and Corporate Change, 25 (6), p. w8; Ahuja, G., Katila, R., Where do resources come from?

This paper categorises the roles played by users, providers, and platforms in different interpretations of the sharing economy. It asks: What different roles do the users, providers, and platforms play in the sharing economy? And: How do the roles differ in various interpretations of the sharing economy? The paper classifies the different interpretations based on their market/non-market logic and concludes that roles are more extensive for users and providers in non-market logic interpretations, while market logic suggests that the platform acts more roles. The user is, despite the peer-to-peer connotation of the sharing economy, often quite passive. Contributions are made to the emerging literature on the sharing economy through highlighting its many different interpretations, where roles help to systematise these. The paper furthermore contributes to the literature on roles through highlighting them as transitory and expanding beyond expectations related to digitalisation. Practically, the systematisation of roles helps to navigate among various business model designs and makes informed decisions when launching platforms in the sharing economy. Additionally, the focus on roles raises important questions on risk sharing, resource provisions, and the creation of value for each participating party. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","Activity-based; interpretation; logic; platform; provider; roles; sharing economy; user",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aaboen, L, Laage-Hellman, J, Lind, F, Öberg, C, Shih, T, Exploring the roles of university spin-offs in business networks (2016) Industrial Marketing Management, 59, pp. 157-166; Acquier, A, Daudigeos, T, Pinkse, J, Promises and paradoxes of the sharing economy: An organizing framework (2017) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 125, pp. 1-10; Adner, R, When are technologies disruptive: A demand-based view of the emergence of competition (2002) Strategic Management Journal, 23 (8), pp. 667-688; Aloni, E, Pluralizing the ""sharing"" economy (2016) Washington Law Review, 91 (4), pp. 1397-1459; Anderson, H, Havila, V, Andersen, P, Halinen, A, Position and role-Conceptualizing dynamics in business networks (1998) Scandinavian Journal of Management, 14, pp. 167-186; Aptekar, S, Gifts among strangers: The social organization of freecycle giving (2016) Social Problems, 63 (2), pp. 266-283; Ballus-Armet, I, Shaheen, SA, Clonts, K, Weinzimmer, D, Peer-to-peer carsharing exploring public perception and market characteristics in the San Francisco Bay Area, California (2014) Transportation Research Record, 2416, pp. 27-6; Beard, F, Integrated marketing communications: New role expectations and performance issues in the client-ad agency relationship?

In the author's opinion, the role of the EU as an audit legislator has significantly changed over time. More specifically, the new audit legislation indicates the ‘rebirth' of the EU as an audit legislator. The article focuses on the role of the EU as an audit legislator, even though the EU also has an important role to play as an accounting legislator. The most important legislative acts when it comes to EU audit legislation are discussed. A number of important trends in EU audit legislation are also identified and discussed. These include an increased legislative focus on Public-Interest Entities (PIEs), a change from a ‘directive only' to a ‘directive and regulation' legislative paradigm, a legislative change from the ‘periphery' to the ‘core’ of auditing, ‘codification' of provisions from the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) in EU legislation as well as a discussion on a possible EU adoption of the ISAs. © 2021.

Public limited liability companies whose shares are publicly traded are PIEs, but the definition of PIE includes more than public limited liability companies whose shares are publicly traded.

The analysis is divided into 3 periods: before and after the VAT hike and during the financial crisis, with the total time period from 2003 to 2013. The sample is composed of 23,388 Portuguese unique firms with 5.1 year-observations per firm. The impact of the massive VAT change is assessed in comparison to the performance of 4,969 Greek and 59,841 Spanish (for robustness) unique firms for the exact time period. The results show that a dramatic VAT increase significantly affects firm profitability in the country of implementation, with the effect even more dramatic than the recent financial crisis. The equivalent to the proposed 10 percent VAT rise in Portugal has caused a significant decline in firm profitability (an average drop of 8.7% compared to 1.5% during the financial crisis), a massive increase in the number of inactive firms and amplified the likelihood of firms to become bankrupt by about three times. Such consequences inevitably affect unemployment and may cause a slump in tax revenue in the long run. Hence, this research has wide practical implications and should be considered by the Greek and Portuguese governments before taking a next step of intervening in the tourism sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Financial crisis; Firm bankruptcy; Impact; Profitability; Value-added tax; VAT change","economic impact; financial crisis; industrial performance; profitability; survival; tax system; tourism economics; tourism market; Portugal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agiomirgianakis, G.M., Magoutas, A.I., Sfakianakis, G., Determinants of profitability in the Greek tourism sector revisited: The impact of the economic crisis” (2013) Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Management, 1 (1); Aguiló, E., Riera, A., Rosselló, J., The short-term price effect of a tourist tax through a dynamic demand model: The case of the balearic Islands (2005) Tourism Management, 26 (3), pp. 359-365; “Restaurants face 10% rise in VAT in 2012”, November 04, 2011 (2011), https://www.portugalresident.com/restaurants-face-10-rise-in-vat-in-2012/, 17.10.2020; Antonakakis, N., Dragouni, M., Filis, G., How strong is the linkage between tourism and economic growth in Europe?

In this way, a large number of retired electric vehicle batteries (REVB) will be produced in a short time and cause new environmental pollution if REVB are not treated properly. To address this problem, one of the major solutions is to realize the echelon utilization of REVB based on the requirements of different application scenarios. Therefore, this study investigates the economic benefits of REVB participating in different Danish electricity markets. The objective function maximizes the profit in the different markets with considering REVB life loss cost in the operational process. Rainflow counting method is employed to accurately estimate the REVB life loss cost, leading to a strong nonlinearity of the optimization problem. Afterward, simulated annealing based particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) method is used to solve the nonlinear problem and find the optimal operational strategies of the REVB. Finally, a case study with considering different situations is provided to analyze the economic benefits of applying REVB in different markets. The results reveal: 1) SAPSO method performs best in finding the optimal results compared with particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing methods, and 2) It is more likely and beneficial to invest in REVB to participate in the regulation market than the day-ahead market. This significance of the study can be summarized as: 1) Theoretically, apart from proposing a simple, cheap and eco-friendly green strategy, i.e., the echelon utilization of REVB in Danish electricity market, we advance the knowledge and call for attention about under which conditions that performing a green strategy can allow environmental-economic benefits simultaneously achievable. 2) The study provides new business opportunities for energy storage and new energy industries, and can help to realize sustainable development to improve people's life and environmental quality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic benefit; Electricity market; Rainflow counting method; Retired electric vehicle batteries; Simulated annealing based particle swarm optimization","Battery electric vehicles; Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric energy storage; Investments; Lithium-ion batteries; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Simulated annealing; Sustainable development; Business opportunities; Electric vehicle batteries; Environmental economics; Environmental pollutions; New energy industries; Operational strategies; Rain flow counting method; Simulated annealing method; Automotive batteries",,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2018YFE0127600","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2018YFE0127600 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Abdulla, K., Optimal operation of energy storage systems considering forecasts and battery degradation (2018) IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 9 (3), pp. 2086-2096; Adedeji, P.A., Akinlabi, S., Madushele, N., Olatunji, O.O., Wind turbine power output very short-term forecast: a comparative study of data clustering techniques in a PSO-ANFIS model (2020) J.

However, the impact of digital platform functions on sustainable brand relationships, and the mediating mechanism of customer’s emotional cognition are still unclear. The functional value of digital services in the property service industry focuses on three dimensions, including service efficiency, personalization, and social interaction. Regarding consumers’ emotional cognition aspect, we investigate value consistency and brand image. The empirical analysis findings suggest: (1) the functional value of smart community service has a significant positive impact on consumers’ emotional cognition and is positively related to the construction of sustainable brand relationships; (2) consumers’ emotional cognition of smart community service is positively related to the sustainable brand relationship; (3) consumers’ emotional cognition plays a complete mediating role between service efficiency and sustainable brand relationship, demonstrating a partial mediating role between personalization and social interaction aspects of functional value and sustainable brand relationship. This study contributes to the customer-based sustainable brand relationship theory in the digital service environment and provides a reference for companies to continuously improve the SCSBP and customer-based brand construction. © 2021 by the authors.

This research is based on a new hybrid method developed by the authors, called Advanced, Reasoned and Organised (ARO) literature review, which improves the quality of literature reviews by integrating the systematic review for quantitative papers, the meta-synthesis for qualitative research and the critical interpretative analysis. Forty-eight articles were included in the literature review. Bibliometric and cluster analyses were carried out. Two hypotheses were applied as filters in the interpretative synthesis of the content and guided the analysis to answer two research questions. The findings underline that RM in SMEs is still a ‘spot’ subject as they put little effort into the risk identification, assessment and monitoring. The lack of procedures and strategies is due to the lack of risk mindfulness and knowledge, and it is related to the managers’ and owners’ risk attitudes. It is fundamental to understand why risk procedures are not implemented and to find a way to raise awareness of the potential benefits of risk and control measures.

This paper explores the mobilization of MNE technologies and local actors in the case of Grundfos LIFELINK and deploys an actor-network theory (ANT) translation framework to unravel immersion processes of MNE technologies in local BoP contexts. The study adopts a longitudinal single-case design to analyze the introduction of MNE pump technology, which provides clean water in Kenyan rural villages. The findings show that a lack of understanding of the local BoP context leads to failure in mobilizing relevant actors for the intended water-provision network and, subsequently, to an initial rejection of the technology. By focusing more on the local actors and by mobilizing additional actors, the MNE technology is successfully translated into the BoP context—albeit without the intended creation of MNE value. The paper contributes to the understanding of how MNEs can achieve technology development in BoP contexts, as well as to the evolution of BoP approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","BoP context; MNE; Translation; Value creation","Social sciences computing; Actor network theory; Base of the pyramids; Immersion process; Multinational enterprise; Pump technology; Rural villages; Technology development; Water provision; Rural areas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abdelnour, S., Branzei, O., Fuel-efficient stoves for Darfur: the social construction of subsistence marketplaces in post-conflict settings (2010) J.

Furthermore, the paper explores how managers use accounting information to shape organizational members’ understanding of changes, and how focusing on cost-consciousness influence professional culture within social services. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a case study, drawing on sensemaking as a theoretical lens. Top management, middle management and staff specialists at a medium-sized Danish municipality are interviewed. Findings: The paper demonstrates how accounting metaphors can be effective in linking cost information and cost-consciousness to operational decisions in daily work practices. Further, the study elucidates how professionalism may be strengthened based on the use of accounting information. Research limitations/implications: The study is context specific, and the role of accounting in professional work varies on the basis of the specific techniques involved. Practical implications: The paper shows how managers influence how professionals interpret and use accounting information. It shows how cost-consciousness can be integrated with social work practices to improve service quality. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on how accounting information influences social work. To date, only a few papers have focused on how cost-consciousness can be understood in practice and how it influences professional culture. Further, the study expands the limited accounting metaphor research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Budgeting; Cost-consciousness; Management accounting; Metaphors; Public sector; Sensemaking; Social services",,,,,,"Innovationsfonden, IFD","When collecting the data, Anne Kirstine Svanholt was an industrial Ph.D. student.

Storytelling science uses Peirce’s abduction-induction-deduction (AID) approach in a self-correcting series of cycles in order to get closer to what is true for the ecology, and what regimes of truth can be deconstructed for particular stakeholders (business, government, people, ecosystem). We demonstrate how storytelling science can be helpful in exploring differences between sustainability strategies and their connections to some other aspect of business modelling. Discussing on the overview of “storytelling science” and SBM strategy, we organize our conceptualization into three sections: (i) how SBM and storytelling in socially responsible capitalism can help understand what is socially and ecologically sustainable, rather than only what is profitable to particular stakeholders; (ii) how are the methodological and philosophical perspectives and (iii) what are the drivers, enablers, barriers in the implementation of an SBM strategy. © Stefan Markovic, Cristina Sancha and Adam Lindgreen 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation in e-business (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (6-7), pp. 493-520; Bakhtin, M.M., (1993) Toward a Philosophy of the Act, , Written as unpublished notebooks written between 1919-1921, first published in the USSR in 1986 with the title K filosofii postupka; 1993 English V.

Using a firm-and institutional-level analysis, our study investigates a critical case from the Bangladeshi garment industry and explores the reasons, rooted in institutions and the business system, that cause firms to become ‘locked in’ at a particular stage of the upgrading ladder. We analyse the nature of the institutions and business systems of Bangladesh and examine how the characteristics of institutions and business systems affect firms’ lock-in. Our study explores four causes of ‘lock-in’: i) a lack of socially-constructed entrepreneurial vision (i.e. focusing on multiple venture creation, political affiliation and power, supply and manufacturing capacity and profit maximization) and ii) ownership and management characteristics, which do not support upgrading to own brand manufacturing (OBM), iii) the nature of governance between buyers and suppliers, and iv) inconsistency in institutional characteristics. The latter issue is seen, for example, in low levels of trust between firms, a lack of government incentives for design lab development and brand internationalisation, inadequate management of bank financing for upgrading, a lack of intermediary institutions to support internationalisation, and low-quality management education. Our study contributes to the GVC and business systems literature by exploring the reasons for the ‘lock-in’ condition that existing literatures have ignored. © Mohammad B. Rana and Matthew M.C.

Drawing on internationalization and GVC perspectives, we examine the critical case of DBL Apparel Company from Bangladesh, which supplies many global brands, including Sweden’s H & M, and has internationalized into Ethiopia. As the company appears to be the first Bangladeshi garment firm to have internationalized, we conduct an in-depth examination over a three-year period of the process and the antecedents affecting the firm’s overseas expansion. We explore how the buyer’s business model, institutional features, and the supplier’s entrepreneurial capability influence DBL’s internationalization. In particular, our study demonstrates how the buyer’s market-driving approach, value creation, delivery, and proposition shape how the buyer shows commitment to the supplier’s internationalization. At the same time, the supplier’s entrepreneurial capability, consisting of visionary leadership, commitment, learning intent, absorptive capacity, and dynamic management skills contribute to its decision to internationalize. Our analysis reveals that a supplier firm does not move toward internationalization based on one-sided commitment only; instead, it is the ‘shared commitment’ of both buyer and supplier in the GVC that contributes to the supplier’s decision to internationalize. We also demonstrate the influence of institutional characteristics in both home and host countries, particularly the role of government and the logics of doing business that facilitate the internationalization decision and process. Our study contributes to internationalization business and GVC literatures. © Mohammad B. Rana and Matthew M.C.

Our study conceptualises SC in light of the CE and derives a framework to measure a firm’s SC in the GVC. Drawing on the three parameters, a) perfect duty, b) specific goals for economic, social and environmental sustainability, and c) a well-defined structure and strategies, we develop a framework to measure SC, leading to six different levels of SC: i) perfectly sustainable corporation, ii) imperfectly sustainable corporation, iii) occasionally sustainable corporation, iv) consistently sustainable corporation in selective areas, v) inconsistently sustainable corporation in selective areas, and vi) occasionally sustainable corporation in selective areas. In addition, we present a discussion of the challenges associated with SC achievement and CE practices. Our proposed framework is validated through the case of H & M. Our study bridges sustainability, the CE, and firm capability, thereby contributing to sustainable strategic management in the global value chain. © Mohammad B. Rana and Matthew M.C.

We understand robustness in terms of plausibility, which in most research traditions is denoted as validity and reliability. A further important contribution is to provide insight into the structuring of intervention-based research in combination with non-interventionist type methods. Based on a decade of interventionist research relating to value creation with over 100 companies, we illustrate the importance of pre-conception and organization of data-structures and research objectives. We argue that interventionist research projects should adhere to a set number of stages and that the motivation for intervention should be linked to expected learning outcomes and how the contribution from the intervention leads to a value-added contribution. © John Dumay, Christian Nielsen, Morten Lund, Maurizio Massaro and James Guthrie 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arbnor, I., Bjerke, B., (2008) Methodology for Creating Business Knowledge, , London: SAGE; Burrell, G., Morgan, G., (1979) Sociological Paradigms and Organizational Analysis, , New York: Heinemann Educational Books; Chiucchi, M.S., Giuliani, M., Who’s on stage?

Our literature review shows that researchers in different parts of the world perceive intellectual capital and intangibles differently, prefer different methodological and conceptual approaches to research, and even use inconsistent vocabulary. By looking at the post-2000 research on intellectual capital and intangibes published in the leading international accounting and management journals, we find that the European research has studied mainly management-related issues with versatile research methods, whereas the American research is more grounded on empirical quantitative methods and accounting perspective. This chapter has implications for future research, by demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of the European and North American research tradition, and outlining a way to progress the international intellectual capital and intangibles research community. © John Dumay, Christian Nielsen, Morten Lund, Maurizio Massaro and James Guthrie 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barker, R., Conservatism, prudence and the IASB’s conceptual framework (2015) Accounting and Business Research, 45 (4), pp. 514-538; Cañibano, L., Sánchez, M.P., Intangibles in universities: Current challenges for measuring and reporting (2009) Journal of Human Resource Costing and Accounting, 13 (2), pp. 93-104; Chaminade, C., Roberts, H., What it means is what it does: A comparative analysis of implementing Intellectual Capital in Norway and Spain (2003) European Accounting Review, 12 (4), pp. 733-751; Cheung, E., Evans, E., Wright, S., The adoption of IFRS in Australia: The case of AASB 138 (IAS 38) Intangible Assets (2008) Australian Accounting Review, 18 (3), pp. 248-256; Cuozzo, B., Dumay, J., Palmaccio, M., Lombardi, R., Intellectual capital disclosure: A structured literature review (2017) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 18 (1), pp. 9-28; (2001) A Guide for Intellectual Capital Statements (English version), , DTI Council, Danish Agency for Trade and Industry, Copenhagen; de Villiers, C., Dumay, J., Maroun, W., Qualitative accounting research: Dispelling myths and developing a new research agenda (2019) Accounting and Finance, 59 (3), pp. 1459-1487; Dumay, J., A critical reflection on the future of intellectual capital: From reporting to disclosure (2016) Journal of Intellectual Capital, 17 (1), pp. 168-184; Dumay, J., Bernardi, C., Guthrie, J., Demartini, P., Integrated reporting: A structured literature review (2016) Accounting Forum, 40 (3), pp. 166-185; Dumay, J., Guthrie, J., Reflections on interdisciplinary critical intellectual capital accounting research (2019) Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 32 (8), pp. 2282-2306; Dumay, J., Guthrie, J., Rooney, J., The critical path of intellectual capital (2018) The Routledge Companion to Intellectual Capital: Frontiers of Research, Practice and Knowledge, pp. 21-39. , J.

Yet in terms of their innovation, readers may have doubts and enthusiastically wonder how it happens. As SOEs’ existence and development were largely based on the institutional arrangement, their efforts for innovation and ecosystem development were also pertinent to it. This chapter thus demonstrates such institutional influence by revealing how the constant economic reform started in the late 1970s fostered the dual innovation systems, how the dual innovation systems determined the disparate motivations, patterns and accessible resources of SOEs’ and private enterprises’ (PEs’) innovations, and how in such a context the SOEs and PEs were stimulated to build up their specialties with suitable orientations of industry, as well as collaborate and compete with each other. © Xielin Liu, Xiao Wang and Yimei Hu 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Brilhuis-Meijer, E., Pigosso, D.C., McAloone, T.C., Integrating product and technology development: A proposed reference model for dual innovation (2016) Procedia Cirp, 50, pp. 32-37; Broadman, H.G., (1995) Meeting the Challenge of Chinese Enterprise Reform., , Washington, DC: World Bank; Cao, J., Pan, X., Tian, G., Disproportional ownership structure and pay-performance relationship: Evidence from China’s listed firms (2011) Journal of Corporate Finance, 17 (3), pp. 541-554; Chen, L., Chen, Y., (2010) Concerto for Mutual Benefit: State-Owned Enterprise’s Innovation Ability and Innovation Support, , Beijing: Economic Management Press; Chesbrough, H., Vanhaverbeke, W., West, J., (2006) Open Innovation: Researching a New Paradigm., , Oxford University Press on Demand; David, P.A., Hall, B.H., Toole, A.A., Is public R&D a complement or substitute for private R&D?

Design/methodology/approach: This research design is guided by our research question: How can manufacturers develop a learning-to-learn capability that enables Industry 4.0 adoption? The authors adopt action research to generate actionable knowledge from a two-year-long action learning intervention at the Danish rooftop window manufacturer VELUX. Findings: Drawing on emergent insights from the action learning intervention, it was found that a learning-to-learn capability based on lean was a core construct and enabler for manufacturers to adopt Industry 4.0 successfully. Institutionalizing an organizational learning scaffold encompassing the intertwined learning processes of systems Alpha, Beta and Gamma served as a significant way to develop a learning-to-learn capability for Industry 4.0 adoption (systematic problem-solving abilities, leaders as learning facilitators, presence of a supportive learning environment and Industry 4.0 knowledge). Moreover, group coaching is a practical action learning intervention for invoking system Gamma and developing leaders to become learning facilitators – an essential leadership role during Industry 4.0 adoption. Originality/value: The study contributes to theory and practice by adopting action research and action learning to explore learning-to-learn as a core construct for enabling Industry 4.0 adoption and providing a set of conditions for developing a learning-to-learn capability. Furthermore, the study reveals that leaders are required to act as learning facilitators instead of relying on learning about and implementing Industry 4.0 best practices for enabling adoption. © 2021, Henrik Saabye, Thomas Borup Kristensen and Brian Vejrum Wæhrens.","Action learning;

Why only teach the mainstream story of a well-functioning economy that performs almost to perfection letting the economy in general operate closely around the intertemporal equilibrium path of harmony? In addition, mainstream macroeconomics could also be exposed to a different kind of criticism. What about ethical aspects? Should macroeconomics concern itself with questions of morality?

With the growing importance of environmental costs associated with finite resources, firms need to revisit their marketing and promotion strategies. This study defines and conceptualizes horizontal/vertical individualism–collectivism (H/V I-C) cultural value orientations as antecedents of sustainable consumption. Drawing on H/V I-C value orientations, this study attempts to build a sustainable consumption model to better understand how horizontal/vertical individualism–collectivism cultural values are reflected in consumers’ sustainable consumption motives and how they can be translated into persuasive advertising appeals tailored to specific cultural segments. This study contributes to provide new theoretical and managerial insights into understanding culturally relevant sustainable consumption motives and to establish appropriate strategies of sustainable consumption promotion in cross-cultural contexts.

Most countries have adopted a strategy of strict lockdowns, leading to a fall in production and a rise in unemployment. From an economic perspective, this lockdown has erupted in supply-and-demand shocks in the economy. In order to investigate the potential impact of these shocks, we develop a post-Keynesian empirical Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) model for Denmark. The impact of these shocks is analyzed in three different scenarios. Overall, our simulation results indicate that temporary (1 year) shocks in the economy will lead to a fall in output but a quick recovery, whereas persistent shocks can lead to a full-blown economic crisis. We find that the impact of these shocks can be lowered by public intervention in the form of fiscal stimulus, which can reduce the impact of these shocks and also improve the speed of economic recovery. We also address the economic consequences of financing this stimulus, and whether such a policy response is feasible. Our main conclusion is that fiscal stimulus seems to be an effective and affordable policy option available to Denmark. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","COVID-19; Denmark; empirical stock-flow consistent models; open economy",,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank Finn Olesen, Mogens Ove Madsen, and the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback.",,,,,,,,,,"Armington, P.S., A Theory of Demand for Products Distinguished by Place of Production (1969) Staff Papers - International Monetary Fund, 16 (1), pp. 159-178; Brown, S., Garino, G., Taylor, K., Household Debt and Attitudes Toward Risk (2013) Review of Income and Wealth, 59 (2), pp. 283-304; Brown, S., Taylor, K., Household Debt and Financial Assets: Evidence from Germany, Great Britain and the USA (2008) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (Statistics in Society), 171 (3), pp. 615-643; Burgess, S., Burrows, O., Godin, A., Kinsella, S., Millard, S., (2016), A Dynamic Model of Financial Balances for the United Kingdom.

We highlight important takeaways that are deemed relevant to the ongoing digital transition process at AAU and the evaluation thereof, discuss students’ experiences in the locally anchored settings and compare findings in a broader context. For our analysis, we utilize NLP transformers and topic modelling to present an overview of themes discussed by the students. Further, we perform bibliometric analyses to gain insights on similar studies published during COVID-19. The study highlights central themes, challenges, and opportunities from a student perspective, and evaluates these within the scope of the PBL model. The study highlights the complex structure of student bodies, showing diverse preferences and effects of moving education online. Social aspects of learning suffered for most, posing challenges for both teaching and group work. Students generally reported positively on the use of recorded lectures, providing opportunities for future blended/flipped learning environments. We discuss the implications for creating hybrid/blended approaches that integrate online and physical learning spaces. © the authors, 2021.

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs systematic literature search method to identify relevant literature from journals. The study then adopts a narrative approach for the review, highlighting the findings from the prior studies and gaps requiring research attention. Findings: The discussions reveal that there is a need for future studies that can unpack small enterprise growth determinants, identify growth-enabling entrepreneurial characteristics and examine the contextual variabilities that shape their effectiveness. Originality/value: There is currently no comprehensive/integrated review exploring the link between financial inclusion and small enterprise growth in SSA. The review, therefore, provides insights that contribute to the development of this stream of research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Africa; Enterprise growth; Entrepreneurship; Financial inclusion; Small businesses",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abor, J., Quartey, P., Issues in SME development in Ghana and South Africa (2010) International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, 39, pp. 218-228; Abor, J.Y., Agbloyor, E.K., Kuipo, R., Bank finance and export activities of small and medium enterprises (2014) Review of Development Finance, 4, pp. 97-103; Abu, B.M., Haruna, I., Financial inclusion and agricultural commercialization in Ghana: an empirical investigation (2017) Agricultural Finance Review, 77 (4), pp. 524-544; Adomako, S., Danso, A., Damoah, J.O., The moderating influence of financial literacy on the relationship between access to finance and firm growth in Ghana (2016) Venture Capital, 18 (1), pp. 43-61; Ahmad, A.Y., Unlocking the potentials of Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) in building local technological capabilities in agro-processing industry (2020) Innovation and Development, 10 (3), pp. 1-25; Ajide, F.M., Financial inclusion in Africa: does it promote entrepreneurship?

Current literature has focused mainly on market knowledge learning’s impact on firm performance in developed markets. This paper focuses on market knowledge learning in emerging markets. The study examined multinational telecommunication organisations that provide mobile services in Pakistan. The relationships between various components of market knowledge learning and firm performance are investigated. The findings suggest that new knowledge acquisition, sense-making of acquired knowledge, and the subsequent implementation contributes to organisational knowledge and positively impacts firm performance.

The loss of orders from global retailers in developed economies has worsened the living conditions for many garment-industry workers in emerging economies, such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam. Many suppliers in these countries have remained locked into relatively low-value, low-margin, low-skilled activities. However, in a relatively little noticed phenomenon, some suppliers have been able to upgrade their capabilities and have internationalized, establishing facilities abroad to strengthen ties to existing buyers. The contributions to this book document this phenomenon, highlighting the factors that promote or hinder higher levels of internationalization, the conditions that influence the development of suppliers’ capabilities, and how some firms achieve higher levels of sustainable production. They do so from various perspectives, including international business, global value chain, strategy, innovation, operations management and sociological perspectives. Together the book’s chapters represent an important contribution to the literature, focusing on important aspects of GVCs using firm-centric analysis that the existing literature tends to downplay. By enabling us to understand those challenges better, those contributions can help to provide ways for suppliers to overcome them. Collectively, therefore, we hope the chapters in this book offer a positive message for suppliers, multinational buyers, and workers within GVCs during a time of unprecedented challenges. © Mohammad B.

This based on the theoretical notion of gamification’s potential to facilitate “third space communication” and games capability to improve user engagement in non-game settings by transforming this space into a “magic circle” of gameplay for innovative thinking. In this paper an initial matrix is presented for discussing the parameters of gamifying development sessions or workshops conducted throughout innovation and development processes. The purpose of the matrix is to visualize the parameters involved in deciding the level of gamification for a workshop setting. Thus, a tool for identifying a balance in implementing game mechanics, one that can serve to support and facilitate innovative processes rather than purely creating and playing a game for its own sake. Therefore, through this paper the parameters of the matrix and gamifying facilitation of innovative development processes through gameplay, is discussed and presented. This is followed by the exemplification of use and application of the gamification matrix through four gamified workshops. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Gamification; Innovation; Workshop design","Computer science; Computers; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Development process; Gameplay; Initial matrixes; Innovative process; Innovative thinking; Magic circle; Third spaces; User engagement; Gamification",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jipa, G., Marin, I., Enterprise gamification in business to consumer (B2C) engagement model (2014) Proceedings of the 8Th International Management Conference Management Challenges for Sustainable Development, pp. 489-496. , , pp; Patricio, R., A gamified approach for engaging teams in corporate innovation and entrepreneurship (2017) World J.

The conceptual model consists of four forces leading to a successful business. Design/methodology/approach: The sample is a stratified one taken from KOMPASS directory and focussing on the Greater Manchester area. In total, 250 firms were chosen to be the population of this survey. In total, 110 surveys were received by email i.e. 24 non-exporters and 86 exporters that were fully completed. Findings: The four forces of the model include the non-exporting activity, the activity before and after the first export order, differences and similarities between non-exporters and exporters and the regular exporting activity. This model’s findings demonstrate important empirical determinants related to four forces, which, in turn, shape the successful exporting activity. Originality/value: The empirical evidence from the study suggests that the major differences between non-exporters and exporters, which include the differences in management perceptions towards exporting, and the differences and similarities of firm and management characteristics, explain only to some degree what constitutes successful exporting behaviour. The model is considered useful for smaller businesses located in the UK. The study highlights the importance of firms before and after the first export order, which provides insights for managers of firms about going through with the first export order rather than withdrawing from this effort. The study reveals the motivations for exporting, the timing, the modes through which firms export, firms’ management characteristics and attitudinal differences between exporters and non-exporters, which are essential for practitioners. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Activity before and after first export order; Differences between exporter vs non-exporters in management perceptions on exporting and management and firm characteristics; Differences between exporters and non-exporters in management and firm characteristics; Exporting and non-exporting behaviours; Non-exporting activity; Regular exporting activity; UK SMEs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aidis, R., Estrin, S., Mickiewicz, T., Institutions and entrepreneurship development in Russia: a comparative perspective (2008) Journal of Business Venturing, 23 (6), pp. 656-672; Anderson, U., Forsgren, M., In search of centres of excellence – network embeddedness and subsidiary role in multinational corporations (2000) Management International Review, 40 (4), pp. 329-350; Anwar, M., Shah, S.Z.A., Khan, S.Z., The role of personality in SMEs internationalization: empirical evidence (2018) Review of International Business and Strategy, 28 (2), pp. 258-282; Autio, E., Creative tension: the significance of Ben Oviatt’s and Patricia McDougall’s article toward a theory of international new ventures (2005) Journal of International Business Studies, 36 (1), pp. 9-19; Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Barney, J.B., Resource-based theories of competitive advantage: a ten-year retrospective on the resource-based view (2001) Journal of Management, 27 (6), pp. 643-650; Benito, G.R.G., Gripsrud, G., The expansion of foreign direct investments: discrete rational location choices or a cultural learning process?

The world over, however, ports vary considerably in their efforts to reduce air emissions, and the causes for this variation remain under-researched. This paper examines the drivers for the adoption of air emissions abatement measures in a sample of 93 of the world's largest ports, covering all continents and mobile emitters. We test five hypotheses with a Linear Probability Model to disentangle the impacts of key port characteristics on the current adoption of abatement measures and identify three key drivers for adoption: Population density, the port landlord business model, and a specialization in servicing container shipping. We also find that ports are more likely to implement specific bundles of measures, in particular combining pricing and new energy sources. Our work has implications for ports, as we suggest that they should coordinate abatement efforts to achieve effectiveness in their work. © 2020 The Authors","Emissions monitoring; Environmental standards; Incentive pricing; Low emissions fuels; Port air emissions abatement measures; Port characteristics","Greenhouse gases; Population statistics; Air emissions; Business modeling; Linear probability models; New energy sources; Population densities; Servicing containers; Air pollution; abatement cost; atmospheric pollution; emission control; fuel consumption; incentive; port operation; standard (regulation)",,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: 895-2017-1003","This research was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Green Shipping Partnership Project (#895-2017-1003).

If scholars are to obtain the explanatory value that can be developed through detailed applications of critical realism, the existing gap between the philosophical foundation, methodological recipes and hands-on practices of applied critical realism must be bridged. Through a literature review and analysis of existing applications of critical realism in MOS studies, this paper presents five particular potentials of applying critical realism. The five potentials each address significant aspects of critical realism that, when explicitly applied in a research process, can contribute to the understanding of management and organizations. Following the analysis, we discuss what characterizes a detailed application and how this can add to the future of critical realism in MOS studies. © 2020 The Author(s).

This has been referred to as pursuing an ambidextrous supply strategy, extending the mobilisation of resources in pursuit of both aims beyond the borders of the lead manufacturer and into supplier organizations as well. Purchasing and supply management plays an increasingly central role in mobilizing and involving the suppliers in the pursuit of this agenda. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the literature on organizational ambidexterity and operations management by exploring how purchasing departments contribute to the organizational pursuit of organizational ambidexterity. We explore practices followed by purchasing departments for mediating tensions between supply networks and organizational functions. © 2020 The Author(s).

Hypothesizing that exploration can be one approach to dissolving the enlightenment-experience conflict by embedding both aspects within the concept of exploration, users reach enlightenment through explorative experiences. Exploration is discussed, theoretically and empirically, as a structure for creating a space for exploration, providing users with multiple levels and types of interaction and experience potential. Throughout the article, we argue that a simple thematic, user-mindset, agency, storification and narrative closure are key criteria for an exhibition to further the potential for exploration by creating multiple perspectives, interaction potential and depth on a specific area of interest, thus maintaining the users’ curiosity and focus. Empirically, we explore how explorative exhibitions affect users’ museum experiences through a user study at two exhibitions designed for exploration: Anguish & Fire and The Amazing Eel. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","case study; Experiential learning; exploration; museum exhibition",,,,,,"Velux Fonden; Nordea-fonden","This research was conducted as part of the Our Museum research and development program ( www.ourmuseum.dk ) and was supported by the Nordea-fonden and the Velux Foundations.

The co-production turn is seen as a historical development from new public management to the concept of new public governance. Ideas on collaborative governance have been advanced as an answer to some of the challenges of the public sector in health services, caregiving, and social work. Current issues in welfare production in public sector organisations are seen as a result of the economic rationalisation ideas in new public management, and co-production has been theoretically advanced as a new way to involve citizens in the co-production of welfare. The co-production turn is explored as an emerging research field in this book, and in the current chapter, the authors explore how three top managers make sense of this concept when developing and implementing new strategies in their public organisations. © 2021, IGI Global.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, A., Willmott, H., Identity regulation as organizational control producing the appropriate individual (2002) Journal of Management Studies, 39 (5), pp. 619-644; Alvesson, M., Beyond neo-positivists, romantics and localists - A reflexive approach to interviews in organization research (2003) Academy of Management Review, 28 (1), pp. 13-33; Berger, P.L., Luckmann, T., (1966) The social construction of reality: A treatise in the sociology of knowledge, , Doubleday; Bingham, L.B., Collaborative governance (2011) The SAGE Handbook of Governance, pp. 386-401. , In M.

However, engineering science shows that new product modules not only change the product architecture, but they can also be used for technologically radical next generation products. Therefore, there seems to be a misalignment in how the role of modular innovation is seen as an innovation management phenomenon and the actual practice of product design and engineering. We revisit the role of modular innovation by combining management and engineering approaches. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach through two cases that utilize patent data of two recent technologically innovative products: Tesla's Model X and iRobot's Roomba automated vacuum cleaner. The examples show, in detail, how the changes in product modules and functions have led to broader changes at the system architecture level, leading to new functionalities. The findings contribute to the innovation management literature by identifying a more nuanced role of modular innovation by embedding it in the product architecture, thus broadening the discussion on architectural innovation and technological radicalness. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Architectural innovation; Modular innovation; Product design; Radical innovation; System architecting; Technology","Architecture; Computer architecture; Patents and inventions; Architectural changes; Architectural innovation; Engineering science; Innovation management; Modular innovation; Product architecture; System architectures; Technological change; Product design",,,,,,"This research was supported by the Department of Business and Management at Aalborg University, Denmark and the Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, Pakistan.","This research was supported by the Department of Business and Management at Aalborg University , Denmark and the Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar , Pakistan.",,,,,,,,,"Abernathy, W.J., Clark, K.B., Innovation: mapping the winds of creative destruction (1985) Res.

MNCs play an important role in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) formulated by the United Nations (UN), as they are responsible for one-third of the total economic output and the majority of world trade. However, little is known about how MNCs contribute to meeting the UN SDGs. Through an in-depth analysis of how Grundfos, a Danish MNC and a leading supplier of pumps, developed a solution for supplying fresh potable water to rural villages in Kenya, we investigate some challenges MNCs face and demonstrate the importance of intimate engagement with the context of strategic action. Tackling sustainable development issues in the context of BoP markets represents a distinctive challenge to MNCs, which often do not have a good understanding of BoP environments. Drawing on contrasting ideas of strategy as navigation or wayfaring, we highlight the dangers of trying to impose existing strategies and business practices in market contexts, which are fundamentally different from existing ones. We add to the existing research by exploring how such frameworks interact with strategizing processes in a novel environment for the operating firm. Specifically, we explore the interrelatedness between planned and emergent approaches to strategizing in BoP market environments. © 2020 The Authors.

By drawing upon the concept known as the variational free energy principle, the paper will explore how this principle can be used to temper rational choice theory by re-formulating how agents optimize. The approach will result in agent behavior that encompasses a wide range of so-called cognitive biases, as seen in the scientific literature of behavioral economics, but instead of using these biases as further indications of market inefficiencies or market failures, the paper will likewise attempt to show the limits to which these biases can inform or critique standard economic theory. The paper therefore offers up a “middle of the road” approach, in which the neoclassical agent is not quite as “rational” as rational choice theory assumes, but at the same time, not quite as irrational as behavioral economics would often have us believe. © Copyright © 2020 Henriksen.","behavioral economics; neuroeconomics; optimizing behavior; rational choice; variational free energy principle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ainslie, G., Derivation of “Rational” economic behavior from hyperbolic discount curve (1991) Am.

The paper, therefore, studies the link between LM and I4.0 from a learning organization (LO) perspective by examining the implementation, commissioning, and utilization of a real-time operational data gathering system at a Danish building material manufacturer. This six months in-depth case study finds that for the manufacturer to utilize real-time operational data from a LO perspective, several barriers must be addressed: problem solving that is not initiated by operators, operators who do not have second-order problem-solving abilities, operators who perceive the new real-time data technology as coercive, poor learning environments and processes, and a lack of leadership that supports learning. This study can help practitioners understand the importance of balance, the prevalent technocentric focus when implementing new I4.0 technologies with a LO focus. Furthermore, the study provides practitioners with a list of specific barriers from a LO perspective to be mindful of when aiming to combine LM and I4.0 to improve production performance. © 2020 by the authors.

The late globalization phenomena are multilevel and multidimensional; this paper offers an initial portal into these phenomena. Understanding late globalization would provide academic insights and help in shaping practices at international, national, sectoral, and corporate levels. The paper follows a macro-conceptual to a micro-empirical path to provide illustrative empirical evidence. Studying the emergence and evolution of Danish Textile and Fashion Industry (DTFI) between 1945 and 2015—a quintessential sector for globalization—allows the examination of several interrelated issues: critical events, impediments, pressures, and turning points that shaped DTFI; main institutional players that motivated key policy changes in and evolution of DTFI; and effects of late globalization on size, mission, location, knowledge, growth, and structure of DTFI. This longitudinal case study of the development of the DTFI brings to the fore key features that shape late globalization at the sectoral-national level: government industrial policies toward domestic and foreign players in an industry, global competition that shapes and continually reshapes (cost as well as quality-driven) location of key value chain activities (and the concomitant global distribution of core competencies and skills), and the growing role of information technologies that enable globally-dispersed value chains to function in cohesive and unified ways. Late globalization has additional levels and dimensions; and we point to implications for future research. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Denmark; industrial policy; industry emergence; industry evolution; international business policy; late globalization; textile and fashion; theory building",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., (2006) Time matters: On the concept of turning point, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Adler, U., Structural change: The dominant feature in the economic development of the German textile and clothing industries (2004) Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management, 8, pp. 300-319; Aldrich, H.E., Fiol, C.M., Fools rush in?

(2018), case studies illustrating creative-problem solving at work is lacking. To help fill this gap, this study aims to show how metaphorical creativity was integrated in the realm of everyday creativity to form a new soap that solves a cleaning crew's challenge. Design/methodology/approach: Participatory observation was the qualitative methodology used to conduct this study. The cleaning team understood they were the research participants under investigation in the food plant. Participatory observation favored an efficient and flexible process for the cleaners to demonstrate their experiential knowledge while the researchers documented the cleaners' routine cleaning practices and challenges. Directly observing and analyzing the cleaners' everyday creative acts inferred face validity. This ensured to a degree that the study was effective at exploring everyday creativity. Findings: Following Finke's Geneplore model in creative cognition (Birdsell, 2019), the consultant shifted between cycles of analogical reasoning in the generative process with exploratory processes to test hypothesis and tailor his thinking. Through this process, the consultant leveraged everyday creativity to develop a small innovation of foaming a non-foaming soap. The foaming process changed the soap's chemistry, enabling the cleaners to remove the spot quickly, accelerating the cleaning process. Research limitations/implications: According to Mumford et al. (2018), case studies illustrating creative-problem solving at work are lacking. In this study, we aim to show how metaphorical creativity was integrated into the realm of everyday creativity to form a new soap that solves an industrial cleaning crew's challenge. To fully understand the variety of metaphorical creativity more qualitative cases need to be analyzed and qualitative research is needed to grasp the scale of metaphorical creativity in everyday creativity. Practical implications: The findings gleaned from this study are beneficial to help organizations solve problems. Viewing problems metaphorically in everyday creativity involves unconventional thinking. When confronted with a challenge that seems impossible to solve, employees should approach the problem from a different angle. Sometimes, a small, innovative act can solve problems that appear hopeless, similar to the Columbus Principle. After all, a challenge is only simple once you know how to pull it off – the triumph is having the courage to try something new and succeeding. With practice, metaphorical creativity is a skill that one can develop. This could e.g. be viewing old problems through a new lens. Applying a new approach may reveal an unconventional solution. Originality/value: According to Mumford et al. (2018), case studies illustrating creative-problem solving at work are lacking. To help fill this gap, this study aims to show how metaphorical creativity was integrated into the realm of everyday creativity to form a new soap that solves a cleaning crew's challenge. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Everyday creativity; Innovation; Job enrichment; Metaphorical creativity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Birdsell, B., Creative cognition: conceptual blending and expansion in a generative exemplar task (2019) IAFOR Journal of Psychology & the Behavioral Sciences, 5 (SI), pp. 43-62; Casakin, H., Metaphorical reasoning and design creativity (2013) Encyclopedia of Creativity, Invention, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship, pp. 1260-1267. , Carayannis, E.G.

It considers critical realism as an alternate theoretical science foundation to the domains of empirical realism and social constructivism that characterize most of the field of organizational learning. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts the approach of a philosophical/conceptual discussion. Findings: This study finds that the critical realist approach makes it possible for organizational learning researchers to apply a prescriptive change agenda. It requires researchers to study the context in which organizational learning occurs. These two features enable the researcher to propose what the world must be like for organizational learning to occur. Hence, a critical realist foundation moves organizational learning theory a step closer to its theoretical sibling, the learning organization. Originality/value: This study reveals the potential in applying critical realism to the study of organizational learning and identifies its related strengths. © 2020, Louise Brøns Kringelum and Jacob Brix.","Critical realism;

The study conducted deep-level interviews with the executive teams of the firm to examine the use of causation and effectuation respectively and to identify which decision-making logic was dominating, from the idea stage through to post internationalisation. The study revealed that the decision-making logic of effectuation vs causation was chosen based on the expectations and perceptions of the future, meaning that psychological factors intervened more often than the actual events unfolding. The study is based on only one case study of a firm operating as a recruiter in the IT sector and there should be caution regarding the generalisability of the findings. © 2020, Allied Business Academies.
