# Module 1 Assignment

Dear all,

We are excited to give you an early sneak peek into the upcoming assignment for Module 1. If you're eager, you can start working on it already. You're free to choose your group members (no random groups from us...you decide), though we recommend groups of about 5 people.

Should you face any challenges, our dedicated TAs are here to help.

## Datasets

You will have 4 datasets to dive into:
- Banking tele-marketing
- Job-search
- Flight Price Prediction
- Mushroom

## Tasks

### 1. Conduct a thorough EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the data

Please refer to the lecture notebooks. Aim for relevant, meaningful visuals instead of trivial ones, like pie-charts simply showing counts of categorical variables.

### 2. Develop a Business Application focusing on Recommendation (UML) and Prediction (SML)

#### 2.1 Objective

Your primary task is to develop a recommendation (UML) and prediction (SML) system, integrating both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques.

#### 2.2 Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction

Explore dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques within the recommender system. Identify features that may correlate or populations that show similarities/differences. Feel free to formulate hypotheses and delve deeper using standard statistics. Think about a job recommendation system for job seekers or a segmentation strategy for targeting customers. The sky's the limit here.

#### 2.3 Supervised Learning

Utilize supervised learning tasks to make predictions, such as identifying which jobs might get filled or which customers are likely to respond to a marketing campaign.

#### 2.4 Think creatively

Choose appropriate algorithms, such as logistic regression and decision trees, for predictive tasks. For the recommendation system part, perhaps a job recommendation system for job seekers or a segmentation strategy for targeting customers. The possibilities are endless!


Best of luck!
