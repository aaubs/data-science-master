# M1 Final Assignment

## Here's what you'll be working on:

### Datasets:

You will have 4 datasets to dive into.
- Banking tele-marketing 
- Job-search 
- Flight Price Prediction 
- Predicting mushrooms - to eat or not to eat

### Tasks:

- **Conduct a thorough EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** of the data. Please refer to the lecture notebooks. Aim for relevant, meaningful visuals instead of trivial ones, like pie-charts simply showing counts of categorical variables.
  
- **Develop a business application** focusing on recommendation (UML) and Prediction (SML). You are welcome to either implement a recommender or a predictive system in the “app development part”:
  
  - **Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction**: Explore the data using dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques. Identify features that may correlate or populations that show similarities/differences. Feel free to formulate hypotheses and delve deeper using standard statistics. Think about developing a job recommendation system for job seekers or a segmentation strategy for targeting customers. The sky's the limit here.
  
  - **Supervised Learning**: Utilize supervised learning tasks to make predictions, such as identifying which jobs might get filled, which customers are likely to respond to a marketing campaign or what a flight may cost given some specific conditions.

    Think creatively—choose appropriate algorithms for predictive tasks. For the recommendation system part, perhaps a job recommendation system for job seekers or a segmentation strategy for targeting customers. Write in the support channel on teams if you are in doubt.

### Deliverables:

- A well-commented notebook detailing your analyses and presenting appealing visualizations. No ugly unnecessary outputs!
  
- An interactive implementation, using platforms like Streamlit or Gradio. This could be deployed on uCloud, Streamlit Cloud or (for grdio) integrated directly into your notebook (with a tad more sophistication than a mere one-button prediction).
  
- An executive brief (max 3 pages) elaborating on your motivation, process and findings. Feel free to refer to pertinent literature that discusses real-world implementations of your models, such as:
  
  - Kenthapadi, K., Le, B., & Venkataraman, G. (2017, August). Personalized job recommendation system at LinkedIn: Practical challenges and lessons learned.
  
  - Moro, S., Cortez, P., & Rita, P. (2014). A data-driven approach to predict the success of bank telemarketing.

**Organize your files in the following structure and submit as a zip:**

- **Notebooks**:
  - .ipynb files (include any !pip installs at the top)
  - Other associated files: like pre-processed data or pickled models
  
- **App**:
  - App.py file
  - requirements.txt (listing the required libraries for deployment)
  - Relevant data files (either hosted in this folder or online, e.g., GitHub)

- **Brief – PDF**

**Note:** You're not required to reference foundational algorithms or methods (e.g., no need to reference the original Random Forest paper).

_Good luck, and enjoy the process!_
