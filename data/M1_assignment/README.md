# Module 1 Assignment

Dear all,

We are excited to give you an early sneak peek into the upcoming assignment for Module 1. If you're eager, you can start working on it already. You're free to choose your group members (no random groups from us...you decide), though we recommend groups of about 5 people.

Should you face any challenges, our dedicated TAs are here to help.

## Datasets

You will have 4 datasets to dive into:
- Banking tele-marketing
- Job-search
- Flight Price Prediction
- Mushroom

## Tasks

1. **Conduct a thorough EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the data.**  
   Please refer to the lecture notebooks. Aim for relevant, meaningful visuals instead of trivial ones, like pie-charts simply showing counts of categorical variables.

2. **Develop a business application focusing on recommendation (UML) and Prediction (SML):**
   a. **Objective:**  
      Your primary task is to develop a recommendation (UML) and prediction (SML) system, integrating both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques.
   b. **Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction:**  
      Explore dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques within the recommender system. Identify features that may correlate or populations that show similarities/differences. Feel free to formulate hypotheses and delve deeper using standard statistics. Think about a job recommendation system for job seekers or a segmentation strategy for targeting customers. The sky's the limit here.
   c. **Supervised Learning:**  
      Utilize supervised learning tasks to make predictions, such as identifying which jobs might get filled or which customers are likely to respond to a marketing campaign.
   d. **Creativity:**  
      Think creatively—choose appropriate algorithms, such as logistic regression and decision trees, for predictive tasks. For the recommendation system part, perhaps a job recommendation system for job seekers or a segmentation strategy for targeting customers. The possibilities are endless!

## Deliverables

- A well-commented notebook detailing your analysis.
- An interactive implementation, using platforms like Streamlit or Gradio. This could be deployed on uCloud, Streamlit Cloud or (for Gradio) integrated directly into your notebook (with a tad more sophistication than a mere one-button prediction).
- An executive brief (max 3 pages) elaborating on your motivation, process, and findings. Feel free to refer to pertinent literature that discusses real-world implementations of your models, such as:
  - Kenthapadi, K., Le, B., & Venkataraman, G. (2017, August). Personalized job recommendation system at LinkedIn: Practical challenges and lessons learned.
  - Moro, S., Cortez, P., & Rita, P. (2014). A data-driven approach to predict the success of bank telemarketing.
- Organize your files in the following structure and submit as a zip:
  - Notebooks:
    - .ipynb files (include any `!pip installs` at the top)
    - Other associated files: like pre-processed data or pickled models
  - App:
    - App.py file
    - requirements.txt (listing the required libraries for deployment)
    - Relevant data files (either hosted in this folder or online, e.g., GitHub)
  - Pitch – PDF

**Note:** You're not required to reference foundational algorithms or methods (e.g., no need to reference the original Random Forest paper).

Good luck, and enjoy the process!
