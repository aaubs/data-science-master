Despite being known for manufacturing autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), Locus identifies itself as a software-focused enterprise. The company's latest product, LocusHub Engine, showcases this commitment by leveraging data collected from AMRs to provide predictive analytics and enhance operational efficiency.\n\nFaulk notes that traditional reporting in warehouses is reactive, focusing on historical data rather than predicting future trends. In contrast, Locus' technology uses AI to forecast upcoming demands and optimize staff allocation between human workers and robots. The software also assists in identifying bottlenecks and improving AMR navigation routes for better performance.\n\nLocus’ journey began when Amazon acquired Kiva Systems, leaving Quiet Logistics (later Locus) without support from its primary supplier. Since then, the company has grown significantly by concentrating on client needs rather than expanding into unrelated areas. This strategic focus helped establish Locus as a market leader in warehouse automation solutions.\n\nWhile interest in automated warehouses surged during the pandemic, recent investor enthusiasm has cooled down slightly. Nonetheless, Locus continues to thrive with modest growth and development efforts. The company’s R&D team is exploring various technologies to further reduce labor requirements within warehouses.\n\nFaulk remains cautious about the immediate adoption of humanoid robots in warehouse environments due to current technological limitations such as battery life and cost constraints."}

Recently, his startup Series Entertainment quietly completed an oversubscribed $28 million Series A round, according to an SEC filing and company confirmation. Investors include Netflix, Dell Technologies Capital, as well as seed backers Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), BITKRAFT Ventures, and F4 Fund. The company was launched just a year ago with a substantial $7.9 million seed funding led by a16z.\n\nIn between fundraising rounds, Series acquired mobile game studio Pixelberry in July, known for its interactive fiction title Choices: Stories You Play.\n\nSeries, also referred to as Series AI, aims to develop video games using large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). The company's goal is to be the new Unity by providing an AI-native, multimodal full-stack game creation platform called Rho Engine. This engine leverages GenAI to expedite game development.\n\nWhile some may doubt if LLMs will revolutionize human life as claimed, gaming is one of the sectors where AI excels. Developers can use AI to handle character design and other tasks, making games more interactive and customizable. Series sees its Rho Engine as distinct from competitors like Modl.ai and Unity's Muse Chat.\n\nHaritatos has an extensive background in game development with a knack for being at the forefront of innovative technology trends. His experience includes building browser games when Adobe Flash emerged and later founding mobile game studios that were acquired by major players such as Zynga and Kongregate. More recently, he led Snap's games group, focusing on augmented reality and embedded games.\n\nThe company's impressive roster of investors reflects its potential in the gaming industry. Besides a16z’s dedicated game fund, Series has also secured backing from BITKRAFT Ventures (founded by eSports pioneer Jens Hilgers) and F4 Fund (led by game entrepreneurs David Kaye and Joakim Achrén).\n\nSeries has rapidly expanded its team to over 100 employees this year, with hires coming from industry giants like Zynga, Machine Zone, Google, and Snap. Despite declining an interview request from TechCrunch upon discovering the Series A raise, Haritatos issued a statement praising his investors and noting the successful fundraising during challenging times.\n\nPitchbook estimates that this $28 million round represents about 15% of Series’ equity stake, valuing the company at around $190 million post-money. However, the company did not comment on the accuracy of this valuation."}

While even the firm’s most ardent supporters did not expect the Ai Pin to revolutionize the world quickly, many critics saw it as an overpriced failure. Similarly, Rabbit R1, another AI-driven handheld device, faced harsh criticism post-launch due to its high price and perceived lack of functionality compared to a free app on a smartphone.\n\nThese setbacks highlight that despite consumer interest in innovative AI devices, no one has yet delivered a truly successful standalone product. Iyo now enters the market with a different approach: integrating advanced language models into Bluetooth earbuds, an already popular category. When Iyo One launches this winter, it will build on years of user familiarity with voice assistants like Alexa and Siri in headphones.\n\nIyo's journey dates back to 2019 when founder Jason Rugolo noticed significant progress being made independently across various research organizations, leading him to believe that foundational models would become commoditized. Unlike Humane, which leveraged its founders' Apple backgrounds, Iyo was incubated within Google’s X lab before spinning off in 2021. While other X projects like Waymo and Wing became subsidiaries, Iyo received initial investment from Alphabet without becoming a subsidiary.\n\nAn advantage for Iyo is that the One isn't its first product; it also sells Vad Pro, a $1650 wired audio device aimed at professional music producers. The Vad Pro includes head-tracking technology and integrates with software to help create spatial audio mixes. In contrast to Humane's and Rabbit's devices, which offer little utility beyond their AI features, the Iyo One can serve as an excellent pair of headphones.\n\nThe Iyo One is priced higher than typical Bluetooth earbuds at $599 for Wi-Fi mode and $699 for cellular mode. However, unlike Humane’s Ai Pin, it doesn't require a monthly subscription fee after purchase. The larger battery size supports up to 16 hours of use when paired with a phone in Bluetooth mode but only around an hour and a half on cellular alone.\n\nThe earbud market is challenging due to competition from major tech companies like Apple and Samsung as well as budget Chinese manufacturers. However, Rugolo believes the Iyo One offers immediate value through superior sound isolation, comfort, and music quality."}

{"title": "AI's Risk of Losing Ground Truth", "date": "2024-07-24T00:00:00", "text": "Imagine an AI model swallowing its own tail, leading to a breakdown known as 'model collapse.' A recent study by British and Canadian researchers warns that this phenomenon is a looming threat. When machine learning models train on data generated by other similar systems, they may start forgetting the true patterns of real-world information over time.\n\nThe process is straightforward: AI systems learn from the most common outputs in their training sets. For instance, if you ask for a picture of a dog, an image generator will likely produce a golden retriever because that breed appears frequently online rather than a rare one. As more and more AI-generated content floods the internet, newer models are increasingly exposed to this skewed data.\n\nThis repeated exposure to heavily biased datasets causes models to generate even more of the same type of content, leading them to lose touch with reality. For example, after training on countless images of golden retrievers, a model might assume that most dogs are golden retrievers and continue to produce even more of these images.\n\nThe research team presents numerous case studies and methods to address this issue but concludes that 'model collapse' is an inevitable theoretical outcome. The lack of diverse and high-quality training data could limit the potential of current AI technology, particularly as it becomes harder to distinguish between original human-generated content and machine-created data.\n\nWhile solutions exist, such as establishing benchmarks for data variety or implementing watermarks on AI-generated material, these are not yet standard practices. Companies may also resist sharing valuable datasets out of fear of losing a competitive edge. As more AI models rely on internet-scraped data, the challenge of maintaining accuracy and diversity in training becomes increasingly significant.\n\nThis warning adds another layer to the ongoing debate about the sustainability of current machine learning approaches and their ability to produce advanced forms of artificial intelligence."}

Grok, pitched as entertaining and helpful, promised timely information by tapping directly into the platform's content for relevant answers. However, after testing it, the question remains: what purpose does it serve?\n\nTechnically, Grok exists because Elon Musk wanted a competitor to ChatGPT. As a paid add-on for Premium Plus subscribers who pay $16 monthly, it aims to reduce reliance on advertising and offer real-time updates akin to pre-Musk days of the platform.\n\nI was among those who previously used Twitter as a search tool for local events and breaking news. After paying $17.42 including tax for X Premium Plus status, I gave Grok a chance.\n\nInitially, the deep integration with the platform created more confusion than ease of use. The interface was cluttered, and navigating through previous queries required scrolling up or losing them entirely. Despite its claim to be 'rebellious' if toggled, humor did not come naturally. General knowledge questions yielded standard responses, lacking edginess.\n\nGrok lacks a free version, making it less appealing compared to other free options such as Bing, Bard, and ChatGPT. While it provided quick and accurate answers for basic queries, it lacked features offered by competitors like text-to-image generation.\n\nThe standout feature of Grok is its ability to provide up-to-date information based on trending topics within the platform.

However, the report conspicuously omits any mention of how much energy is consumed by artificial intelligence (AI). This omission may be due to the fact that AI's energy consumption is significantly higher than what would be comfortable to disclose.\n\nThe report contains several notable projects, such as a water replenishment program designed to offset water usage in its facilities. By funding watershed restoration and irrigation management projects worldwide, Google has already managed to restore 18% of its water use, with plans for continued improvement. Additionally, the company leverages AI to optimize water systems, reduce fuel consumption through route optimization, and predict floods.\n\nDespite these initiatives, when it comes to discussing the energy consumed by AI, the report becomes vague. The section titled “Responsibly Managing Resource Consumption of AI” notes that predicting future environmental impacts of AI is complex and evolving, suggesting that historical trends may not fully capture its trajectory. Furthermore, Google emphasizes that the distinction between AI workloads and other data center activities will become less meaningful as AI integration increases.\n\nGoogle’s emissions in 2023 were reported at 14.3 million tCO₂e, marking a 13% increase from the previous year and a 48% rise since its 2019 target base year. The company attributes this growth to increased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions. Notably, Google pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030 but acknowledges significant uncertainties in reaching that goal.\n\nIn the report, Google minimizes the significance of AI’s impact on its overall energy use, stating that the total energy used for running servers is only about 0.1% of global energy consumption. However, this downplay does not address the growing concerns over AI's escalating energy demands and the need to reduce emissions.\n\nGoogle has a vested interest in avoiding detailed disclosure of AI’s energy costs, despite its expertise in cloud computing and data center management. The company acknowledges efforts to make custom AI server units more efficient and to decrease the energy required for training models by 100x, yet it refrains from providing specific figures on the impact of these initiatives.\n\nWhile the report showcases numerous positive environmental contributions from Google, it remains crucial to address the significant and increasing energy consumption associated with AI systems. The company’s reluctance to disclose detailed information about AI's energy use suggests that this issue may become more pressing in future reports."}

Japan's aging population and strong inclination towards technology have made it a leader in the age tech robotics market for over three decades.\n\nWith around one-third of its population aged 65 or older, Japan has been exploring robots as potential caregivers due to an increase in life expectancy, which can lead to social isolation among seniors. In the United States, while aging trends are similar but less pronounced, there is a growing need for solutions like robotic companions.\n\nThe New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA) initiated a program in 2018 to distribute robot pets to senior citizens, inspired by the popularity of these devices among younger people. Acting Director Greg Olsen shared that the initiative has provided over 31,500 robotic companions to older New Yorkers.\n\nAgeless Innovations manufactures three types of robotic pets: a dog, a cat, and birds designed for walking aids. These robots mimic real animals by responding to touch and sound, helping combat loneliness among elderly individuals who may not be able to care for traditional pets due to health issues or physical limitations.\n\nStudies have shown that pet ownership can significantly reduce feelings of isolation in older adults. However, given the recent introduction of robotic companions, there is less research on their long-term effects compared to actual animals. A 2022 study indicated that robot pets could improve mental well-being without the risks associated with medication.\n\nWhile robotic pets offer a promising approach to addressing loneliness, they are not a replacement for human interaction and care. Olsen emphasizes that NYSOFA collaborates with several tech firms, such as Intuition Robotics, which offers social robots like ElliQ to enhance connections between seniors and their loved ones or caregivers. The office also provides other essential services like transportation.\n\nThe robot pet program has been successful in engaging elderly users emotionally, as evidenced by stories of strong attachments forming between people and their robotic companions."}

Serial entrepreneur David Sacks, a former Yammer executive whose company was sold to Microsoft for $1.2 billion in 2012, claims he has found a solution to this problem. He has partnered with Evan Owen, previously Vice President of Engineering at Zinc, which ServiceMax acquired in 2019.\n\nTogether, they launched Glue, an employee chat app that combats what is referred to as 'Slack channel fatigue'. The application focuses on topic-based threads and utilizes generative AI. This enterprise was initially incubated by Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm Sacks founded, through several seed rounds.\n\nGlue began its journey in 2021 when Owen joined Craft Ventures as an entrepreneur-in-residence alongside Sacks, both of whom had numerous ideas for improving workplace messaging and saw the potential for innovation. They believe that by rearranging communication into threads rather than channels, they can reduce information overload felt by users.\n\nOn Slack, conversations take place within specific channels, requiring everyone who wants to participate in a group discussion to join these channels. This often results in individuals being part of numerous irrelevant channels, leading to overwhelming noise levels. In contrast, Glue organizes all communication into threads accessible only to relevant participants.\n\n\"You can initiate a thread for a particular task,\" said Owen, the CEO and co-founder of Glue. \"Once the conversation is complete, it disappears unless someone mentions the topic again.\" This ephemeral nature of conversations ensures that users do not have to keep up with discussions they are no longer part of.\n\nGlue's interface resembles Slack but is designed to display information pertinent only to each user. Sacks asserts that replicating Glue’s functionality would require a complete overhaul of existing platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams.\n\nThe application’s AI capabilities include suggesting topic names for threads, summarizing conversations over time, and identifying employees' roles based on chat history. Users can choose between ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude as the AI model powering Glue.\n\nCraft Ventures has been utilizing Glue internally for a year before offering it to external companies starting Tuesday. After a three-month trial period, Glue will be available at $7 per employee monthly, which is slightly less than Slack’s basic package pricing.\n\nSacks hints that Glue may soon seek its first round of external funding after unveiling the app. 'If you have a great product in AI space, you can raise Series A right away,' he said."}

{"title": "A Handy Device for Note-Taking on-the-Go", "date": "2024-09-20T00:00:00", "text": "The Plaud.AI pin fits nicely in my travel bag and offers a solution for taking detailed notes during meetings. I usually bring my laptop to jot down important points, but typing can be distracting and disrupt the conversation flow. Shorthand isn't always readable either, so recording conversations seems like a good alternative. However, smartphones tend to pick up ambient noise and typing sounds, leading me to miss the days of dedicated voice recorders.\n\nPlaud.AI's NotePin is designed specifically for this scenario. It attaches magnetically to your phone or wristband and uses ChatGPT to transcribe conversations in real-time. While I haven't tested their earlier product, the NotePin caught my attention with its convenience. During meetings where note-taking becomes a ritual rather than an essential task, having recordings that can be easily transcribed later is incredibly useful.\n\nAt $169, the device comes with 300 free monthly transcription minutes. Upgrading to a Pro plan for $6.60 per month quadruples these minutes and adds features like custom templates and 'Ask AI' which provides more detailed information from recordings. For those who attend numerous meetings each month, this upgrade could be worthwhile.\n\nOne of the standout features is its deliberate design: the user initiates recording by tapping it once, and another tap stops it. This intentional act may alert others that a conversation is being recorded. The app also allows users to check if the device is currently active, ensuring no unintended recordings occur.\n\nTranscriptions from GPT are generally accurate and helpful for summarizing discussions. Speakers can be easily identified by voice, and summaries are useful for quick reference. Additionally, sharing audio clips with colleagues via a link is straightforward.\n\nAs an Otter user, I miss the ability to play back specific segments of recorded conversations directly through the transcription interface. Despite this drawback, Plaud's device feels like a practical solution to real-world problems faced by professionals who need to take detailed notes in meetings."}

The cost of operating ChatGPT alone was said to be about $700,000 per day.\n\nWith more than 250 million users, including around 10 million paying subscribers, ChatGPT is a major source of revenue for the company, contributing over $2 billion annually. Microsoft's integration with Azure OpenAI Service further bolsters OpenAI’s market standing.\n\nHowever, the competitive landscape remains intense as rivals such as Anthropic and xAI continue to develop their own AI products. Google, Amazon, and Meta are also investing heavily in infrastructure for powerful next-generation models while pursuing strategies to commoditize text- and image-generating AI.\n\nFacing these pressures, OpenAI may raise the cost of its premium ChatGPT Plus plan from $20 per month to $44 by 2029. Additionally, there are plans to modify its corporate structure to attract more investments. Currently governed by a non-profit entity that caps investor returns, OpenAI is expected to transition towards for-profit governance in the near future.\n\nIn addition, investors in this latest round will have the option to retrieve their funds if OpenAI fails to convert to a for-profit organization within two years. This move could provide the company greater flexibility to pursue capital-intensive long-term projects and reduce reliance on Nvidia’s hardware.\n\nDespite these strategic initiatives, recent executive departures raise questions about OpenAI's ability to execute its plans successfully. Prominent figures such as CTO Mira Murati, chief research officer Bob McGrew, research VP Barret Zoph, former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, and co-founder John Schulman have left the company in recent months.\n\nOf the original 13 founders who started OpenAI in 2015, only three remain."}

Court documents describe the suspect, Steven Anderegg, as highly skilled in technology with a background in computer science and over two decades of experience in software engineering. In October 2023, law enforcement identified Anderegg after the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children flagged messages he sent to an underage individual on Instagram containing AI-generated images.\n\nInstagram records indicate that Anderegg posted a story featuring realistic generative AI images of minors dressed in BDSM-themed leather clothing and encouraged followers to explore similar content on Telegram. He also allegedly engaged in private conversations with other users, expressing his desire for sexual encounters with prepubescent boys and boasting about having numerous AI-generated CSAM images.\n\nWhen Anderegg learned that one user was only 15 years old, he reportedly continued sending sexually explicit AI-generated images without hesitation. During a search of Anderegg’s computer, law enforcement discovered over 13,000 images, many depicting nude or semi-clothed prepubescent minors, generated using the Stable Diffusion text-to-image model with highly specific prompts and negative filters to avoid adult depictions.\n\nSeveral tech companies, including Google, Meta, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Amazon, have committed to reviewing their AI training data for CSAM and implementing stress tests to prevent model-generated CSAM. Stability AI also pledged to adhere to these principles.\n\nProsecutors claim that this is not Anderegg’s first encounter with law enforcement regarding the possession of child sexual abuse material through a peer-to-peer network. In 2020, someone using internet access at his home attempted to download known CSAM files. During an investigation in 2020, Anderegg admitted to having a peer-to-peer network on his computer but was not charged."}

{"title": "AI Models Still Struggle With Hallucinations", "date": "2024-08-14T00:00:00", "text": "A recent study reveals that all generative AI models produce unreliable information at times. From Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude to OpenAI’s latest release, these systems often generate false or misleading content. However, the extent of misinformation varies among different models depending on their training data sources.\n\nResearchers from Cornell University, the universities of Washington and Waterloo, and a nonprofit institute conducted a fact-checking study comparing model outputs against authoritative sources in various fields such as law, health, history, and geography. They found that none of the examined models excelled across all topics, with some performing better by abstaining from answering questions they could not answer correctly.\n\nWenting Zhao, a doctoral student at Cornell and co-author of the research, stated that current AI models generate truthful responses only about 35% of the time. Previous studies have tested models with Wikipedia-based answers but this new benchmark challenges them with non-Wikipedia topics to reflect real-world queries more accurately.\n\nOver a dozen popular models were evaluated, including GPT-4o, Meta’s Llama 3 70B, Mistral’s Mixtral 8x22B, Cohere's Command R+, and others. Results indicate that none of these models have significantly reduced hallucinations despite vendor claims.\n\nGPT-4o and GPT-3.5 from OpenAI had comparable accuracy rates on the benchmark test. OpenAI’s models were among the least prone to generating false information, followed by Mixtral 8x22B, Command R+, and Perplexity's Sonar models. Questions about celebrities and finance posed significant challenges for all tested models while geography and computer science questions were easier.\n\nThe study also found that models struggle more with non-Wikipedia questions compared to those sourced from Wikipedia. Smaller models like Claude 3 Haiku hallucinated nearly as often as larger ones such as Claude 3 Opus, indicating model size does not significantly impact accuracy.\n\nZhao suggests that vendors should focus on reducing hallucinations through rigorous fact-checking and human verification during development. She notes the persistent issue of conflicting information in training data due to its human origin. As a temporary solution, programming models to avoid answering questions they cannot confidently answer may be beneficial.\n\nClaude 3 Haiku abstained from answering about 28% of questions, making it the most truthful model when considering only answered queries. However, Zhao predicts that users might prefer models with higher response rates. Therefore, vendors should prioritize research aimed at mitigating hallucinations.\n\nZhao emphasizes the importance of policies and regulations to ensure human experts verify information generated by AI models. She highlights opportunities for developing advanced fact-checking tools, providing citations for factual content, and correcting erroneous data."}
{"title": "Navigating Bias in AI Image Generators", "date": "2024-02-24T00:00:00", "text": "Staying current with advancements in artificial intelligence can be challenging. Here is a summary of recent developments and discussions surrounding AI, focusing on the issue of bias in image generation systems.\n\nGoogle's latest controversy centers around its image generator's handling of diversity, sparking debate about how these tools should address representational fairness. While proponents argue for more inclusive algorithms, critics worry about oversimplifying complex social issues through technological means.\n\nA recent study by Amazon researchers suggests that large language models (LLMs) possess a surprising degree of nuanced understanding. By examining sentence trajectories in LLMs, the team discovered that these systems can differentiate between semantically similar sentences even when their grammatical structures differ. This finding indicates that LLMs encode more sophisticated meaning than previously thought.\n\nIn another development, Swiss researchers at EPFL found neural encoding techniques to be particularly effective for improving prosthetic vision technology. Using machine learning approaches, they were able to enhance the resolution of artificial retinas and other visual systems, enabling better transmission of detailed images despite hardware limitations.\n\nStanford researchers explored how children develop drawing skills through an analysis of 37,000 drawings submitted by kids depicting various objects and animals. Surprisingly, their study revealed that older children's drawings became more recognizable not due to the inclusion of specific features but rather from a combination of complex elements identified by machine learning models.\n\nEPFL chemists also demonstrated LLMs' potential in chemistry research. After minimal fine-tuning on existing literature, these models can answer intricate yes/no questions about chemical properties that individual researchers might struggle with. This showcases the utility of LLMs as powerful tools for knowledge retrieval and synthesis.\n\nHowever, a cautionary note comes from Berkeley researchers who found gender biases persistently reinforced through imagery rather than text when searching online databases related to specific professions or terms. Their study indicated that images tend to enforce stereotypes more strongly compared to textual descriptions and influence perceptions long after viewing.\n\nUltimately, as discussions around AI continue, it's crucial not to overlook the pervasive presence of bias within training data for many models. Such biases can have significant real-world impacts on individuals and society."}

In 2014, he joined Baidu as Chief Scientist but left in 2017 to establish multiple AI ventures, including DeepLearning.ai courses and Landing AI, an enterprise focused on developing AI solutions for manufacturing firms.\n\nLaunched in 2018 with $175 million, the first AI Fund was established by Ng as a general partner (GP) with the goal of supporting companies during their seed and Series A stages. This fund helps teams operate discreetly until they are ready to launch fully and connects them with Ng’s extensive network.\n\nThe initial backers included Greylock Partners, New Enterprise Associates, Sequoia Capital, and SoftBank Group. Crunchbase lists 38 portfolio companies such as WhyLabs (an AI observability platform), Landing AI, and Baseten (an AI application builder).\n\nDespite being smaller than its predecessor, at $120 million the second AI Fund vehicle is still significantly larger than the initial target of $50 million. This development could suggest that the AI market bubble, particularly in the high-profile generative AI sector, might be starting to deflate.\n\nPitchBook recently reported a sharp decline in early-stage generative AI dealmaking over two consecutive quarters, dropping 76% from its peak in Q3 2023. The value of venture capital deals for pre-seed and seed stages fell to $122.9 million in Q1 2024 compared to a high of $517.7 million in Q3.\n\nEnterprise hesitation may be contributing to this trend. Surveys from Boston Consulting Group show that half of C-suite executives do not anticipate significant productivity gains from generative AI and are concerned about potential errors and data security issues stemming from these tools. Recent studies indicate that businesses find implementing generative AI at scale more challenging than initially expected, leading executives to approach the technology with caution."}

Morph Studio, a new tool designed for this purpose, has recently launched. The platform uses its own text-to-video technology alongside a collaboration with Stability AI to enable users to create and edit shots by providing textual descriptions. This process forms the core of their creative workflow which includes generating, editing, and cross-cutting footage within a storyboard-like interface.\n\nMorph’s co-founder Xu Huaizhe explained in an interview that traditional filmmaking involves distinct phases such as filming, editing, and post-production, but AI technology has integrated these stages into one continuous process. If users are unsatisfied with their work, they can regenerate it directly within the Morph Studio canvas.\n\nXu and his team of former computer vision PhD students from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology established Morph Studio in 2023. They see ByteDance’s CapCut as a competitor but aim to stand out by fostering a strong community among creators, making it hard for competitors like ByteDance to replace them easily.\n\nMorph is currently employing about ten people and has secured $2.5 million in funding from Baidu Ventures. Initially focusing on meme generation through AI-created GIFs, the platform later shifted its attention towards high-definition video production. Users can now choose between Morph’s own model and Stability AI for their creations.\n\nXu noted that young individuals often communicate via memes rather than traditional media, leading to the development of image-based communities like Reddit and 9Gag. Recognizing this trend, he initiated a Telegram group where participants exclusively used GIFs generated by Morph's AI to express themselves. Within days, the group grew to over 300 members, with users posting animated clips featuring well-known personalities like Elon Musk in a spacesuit or Donald Trump dancing at a disco.\n\nThis experiment revealed that people enjoy content even if it looks slightly artificial, especially when used to convey deeper meanings beyond words alone. Since then, Morph has redirected its focus towards enhancing the film production platform."}

The company has removed its controversial 'Dear Sydney' advertisement from airtime after receiving widespread criticism. In the 60-second spot, a father uses Google's Gemini AI to craft a fan letter for his daughter to her Olympic hero, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, instead of helping her write it herself. This prompted numerous social media users and Alexandra Petri from The Washington Post to criticize the ad for not capturing the essence of heartfelt communication. Many felt that the commercial missed the point of a sincere fan letter by suggesting an AI tool could replace human effort and emotion.\n\nIn response, Google stated that the ad was intended to demonstrate how Gemini can assist with initial drafts or provide creative ideas rather than fully substituting human creativity. This isn't the first time tech companies have faced negative reactions while showcasing artificial intelligence in advertisements. For instance, Apple's 'Crush' commercial also received significant backlash for similar reasons.\n\nAt its core, the controversy revolves around the perception of AI encroaching on human authenticity and expression. People generally value genuine personal connections over automated substitutes, especially when it comes to meaningful interactions like fan letters. McLaughlin-Levrone herself might find a heartfelt letter from an admirer more touching than one crafted by technology."}

{"title": "The Significance of Musk's Grok AI Release", "date": "2024-03-18T00:00:00", "text": "Recently, Elon Musk’s xAI company released its Grok large language model (LLM) as open source. This move is intended to position xAI against its competitor OpenAI. However, the question arises whether making Grok’s code public truly benefits the AI development community. The answer is both yes and no.\n\nGrok functions similarly to other chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude by responding to user queries. Notably, it has been trained with a sassy tone and has access to extensive Twitter data for differentiation. Despite its unique features, Grok appears to be on par with previous generation models such as GPT-3.5.\n\nThe release of Grok’s internal workings can provide valuable insights for developers, although the term “open source” in AI context is ambiguous. Unlike traditional software, AI models like Grok involve complex training processes that are not easily replicable or audited by others due to proprietary data and computational resources required.\n\nAI companies have been using different criteria to label their models as “open,” leading to confusion over the actual meaning of openness in this domain. For instance, some claim a model is open if it has an accessible API or published research papers describing its development process. At best, releasing the neural network weights provides limited transparency.\n\nMoreover, creating and replicating AI models demands substantial financial investment and high-performance computing capabilities. Therefore, Grok’s release as an open-weights model with 314 billion parameters offers significant material for developers to explore but comes with considerable resource requirements.\n\nDespite its size, using Grok in its raw form necessitates extensive hardware resources that are out of reach for most individuals and small companies. Additionally, it is not clear whether this version represents the latest or optimized iteration of Grok available internally.\n\nWhile releasing Grok’s code is beneficial, it does not fundamentally alter the dynamics of AI development as some had anticipated. The motivation behind Musk’s decision remains questionable — is xAI genuinely committed to open-source practices, or is it a strategic move against OpenAI?\n\nIf xAI intends to foster genuine collaboration and transparency, ongoing support and further releases will be crucial. Otherwise, this initiative may merely serve as a talking point in online debates.\n"}

{"title": "Startup Uses AI Bots for Debt Negotiation and Banking Outreach", "date": "2024-02-13T00:00:00", "text": "A startup known as Cambio is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to transform the banking industry by integrating AI bots into customer interactions. Initially, Cambio offered an AI service that negotiated debt collections on behalf of consumers, resulting in resolution for about 70% of users and improved credit scores within two months. This success led the company to develop an API for banks and credit unions, enabling them to use AI for sales outreach calls.\n\nCambio was founded by Blesson Abraham, a former banking professional who co-founded SavvyIntel, which was acquired in 2017. Inspired by his personal debt struggles during his previous venture, Abraham aimed to create an app that would help people manage their finances better. After Cambio joined the Y Combinator accelerator program, it pivoted its focus to assist users in getting out of debt.\n\nCambio's user base grew significantly over a year, reaching nearly 90,000 individuals, and the company shifted from offering free services to charging fees. One of their recent features involves an AI bot that guides customers through conversations with debt collectors, providing real-time advice based on data collected during calls.\n\nCambio's technology has evolved to include bots capable of handling entire calls independently by negotiating debts for users after obtaining a signed power of attorney. Over time, the system became more reliable and effective, improving credit scores for 70% of participants within two months.\n\nBuilding upon this success, Cambio introduced AviaryAI, an AI-driven solution designed to help financial institutions conduct sales outreach calls with customers. Despite recent FCC regulations against AI-initiated robocalls, Cambio asserts that its technology adheres to legal standards and works closely with regulatory bodies to ensure compliance.\n\nWhen making these calls, the company clearly informs recipients they are speaking with a virtual assistant rather than a human representative. The system includes three bots working in tandem: one initiating contact, another monitoring for issues, and a third evaluating call quality through analysis of tone and content.\n\nEarly adopters such as Envisant, Encurage Financial Network, Agenium, and Skyla Credit Union are testing this innovative technology. Meanwhile, Cambio continues to support its consumer app while focusing on monetization opportunities within the business-to-business (B2B) sector.\n\nTo fuel expansion, Cambio secured $3 million in seed funding from various investors including Builders, DVC, EGR Partners, Envisant, Encurage Financial Network, Goodwater Capital, Leonis Investissement, Sandhill Capital, YC, and angel investors. This financial backing will enable the company to further develop its user-friendly AI solutions aimed at enhancing transparency and empowering individuals in managing debt and improving their credit scores."}

Shane Jones, who has been employed by the company for six years, informed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that despite repeated warnings from him, the firm did not take down its Copilot Designer software.\n\nDuring his investigation of the application’s safety features and vulnerabilities, he discovered it could produce images depicting violent scenarios involving minors, sexually explicit content featuring women in distressing situations, and illegal activities like underage drinking or drug use. In one instance, the AI rendered Disney characters such as Elsa from 'Frozen' in settings reflective of conflict zones.\n\nSince December, Jones has attempted to alert his employer about these issues multiple times without success. He first shared his findings on LinkedIn but was instructed by Microsoft’s legal representatives to remove the post, which he complied with. In a letter submitted to the FTC, Jones expressed frustration over the company's reluctance to address the matter.\n\nIn response to concerns raised internally and externally, Microsoft maintains that they have procedures in place for addressing employee-reported issues. The corporation highlighted its commitment to investigating all reported safety breaches through established channels. Additionally, it mentioned convening meetings with product heads and their Office of Responsible AI to review such reports meticulously.\n\nEarlier this year, Jones also informed a group of US senators about the tool’s tendency to generate graphic imagery linked to public figures, leading to swift condemnation by Microsoft's CEO who pledged to enhance security measures. Last month, another major tech company briefly shut down its equivalent service due to user-generated racially inaccurate and historically misleading images."}

The board suggests changing the terminology from 'derogatory' to 'nonconsensual,' and relocating these policies under the 'Sexual Exploitation Community Standards' section instead of 'Bullying and Harassment.'\n\nCurrently, the company's policies address AI-generated explicit images within a 'derogatory sexualized Photoshop' rule in the Bullying and Harassment guidelines. The board further advises replacing 'Photoshop' with a broader term for manipulated media.\n\nThe firm prohibits nonconsensual imagery if it is generated privately or without commercial intent. However, the oversight committee suggests that this clause should not be required to remove such images created through AI manipulation or other unauthorized means.\n\nThis recommendation comes after two significant incidents where explicit, AI-generated photos of public figures were posted on its social media platforms, causing controversy.\n\nIn one case, an Indian public figure had a nonconsensual image circulated online. Users reported the content but it was not removed until the oversight body intervened and took action. Similarly, another incident involved an American public figure with an AI-generated photo that was promptly deleted upon re-upload due to its presence in the company's Media Matching Service repository of violative images.\n\nInterestingly, the Indian public figure’s image was only added to this repository after pressure from the oversight committee. The firm had previously stated there were no media reports to justify inclusion.\n\nThe board expressed concern over such practices noting that many nonconsensual depictions are trivialized as identity theft rather than gender-based violence. This can lead to additional trauma for victims when reporting these cases to authorities and once online, images quickly disseminate beyond the initial platform.\n\nAn Indian organization combating online gender-based violence noted cultural implications of this issue. They emphasized that users often lack awareness about automatic closure of their reports within 48 hours and suggested the company needs more user education on such issues.\n\nDevika Malik, a former expert from Meta's South Asia policy team, stressed earlier this year that relying solely on user reporting for nonconsensual imagery is unreliable when dealing with AI-generated content. Platforms might struggle to capture necessary external signals in time before harmful traction builds.\n\nAparajita Bharti of The Quantum Hub recommended allowing users to provide detailed context while filing reports since they may not be fully aware of the policy's nuances.\n\nIn response, Meta stated it will review these suggestions."}

Founded by Shiv Rao, a cardiologist based at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), the company started as an innovative solution to streamline medical documentation through artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Back in 2019, Rao proposed his idea to Andy Weissman from Union Square Ventures (USV). Despite finding it unconventional initially, USV eventually backed Abridge with a $5 million seed investment.\n\nAbridge developed a basic transcription app that physicians could use on their smartphones during patient consultations. By collecting data from these interactions, the company built its large language model (LLM), which can now automatically generate detailed medical notes for doctors to review and approve. As generative AI became more widespread in recent years, Abridge has seen rapid growth, especially among major healthcare systems that are eager to adopt its technology.\n\n\"The sales cycle for these big organizations can extend up to 18-24 months,\" said Rao. But once hospitals decide on a solution, they often commit extensively to it. Since early 2024, Abridge has secured contracts with numerous health systems at an unprecedented pace. Hospital executives and doctors have praised Abridge's software for transforming their workflows and improving patient care.\n\n\"It’s one of the most impactful innovations in healthcare,\" Dr. Lee Schwamm from Yale New Haven Medical System told TechCrunch. \"With Abridge, doctors no longer need to worry about administrative tasks during consultations, which enhances their ability to focus on what really matters—patient interaction.\" Additionally, Abridge supports multiple languages and integrates seamlessly with Epic, a widely used electronic health records system.\n\nHowever, the future of Abridge's dominance remains uncertain. As larger players like Microsoft and Google continue to develop advanced AI models, they could potentially challenge Abridge's position in the market. Yet for now, most investors believe that Abridge is ahead of its competitors. The company recently raised $150 million in a Series C funding round led by Lightspeed Ventures, valuing it at $850 million."}

The MGIE (MLLM-Guided Image Editing) tool can handle various tasks such as cropping, resizing, flipping, and applying filters via text commands. This technology combines two approaches: interpreting user instructions and visualizing the intended modifications. For instance, specifying 'make the sky bluer' might increase the brightness of the sky area in an image. Users simply type their edits into MGIE's interface to see changes immediately applied to photos. The model can transform a picture of a pepperoni pizza by adding vegetables when prompted to make it healthier and enhance lighting conditions for dimly lit images like tigers in the Sahara.

However, these models often train on artwork without artists' consent or compensation. To address this issue, entrepreneurs are developing tools to modify artworks so they cannot be used for training generative AI models. One such tool is Kin.art, which was launched recently by Flor Ronsmans De Vry and his co-founders Mai Akiyoshi and Ben Yu. Kin.art uses image segmentation and tag randomization to interfere with the model's ability to train on artwork accurately. This approach makes it harder for vendors to use the artwork in their training datasets without permission, thereby protecting artists' rights.\n\nAccording to Ronsmans De Vry, Kin.art’s tool is an ethical solution that prevents artworks from being included in AI training datasets initially. Unlike other methods that require expensive cryptographic modifications, Kin.art's approach does not involve such costs and can be combined with existing measures for enhanced protection. The tool is currently offered free of charge but requires artists to upload their artwork onto the Kin.art platform, which provides a range of commission-finding and facilitation services.\n\nRonsmans De Vry emphasizes that while the primary goal is to protect artist rights, there are also commercial interests involved in promoting Kin.art’s core business. In the future, Kin.art plans to offer its solution as a service for third parties, allowing small websites and large platforms to safeguard their data from unauthorized use. This initiative aims to help organizations manage public-facing services without compromising on data security."}

According to a Reddit discussion, Gemini provides detailed and erroneous outcomes for Super Bowl LVIII, favoring the Kansas City Chiefs over the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIn one instance, Gemini attributes an unrealistic performance to Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs, who supposedly ran for 286 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. The chatbot also mentions that Brock Purdy of the 49ers ran for 253 yards with a touchdown. Microsoft's Copilot, another AI-driven chatbot, erroneously claims that the 49ers won the game with a score of 24-21.\n\nInterestingly, OpenAI’s ChatGPT did not make similar mistakes in my tests, indicating variations between different models. These inaccuracies highlight significant limitations of generative AI systems and caution against trusting them blindly. Generative AI works by predicting patterns from vast amounts of data available online but lacks the ability to discern truthfulness.\n\nThe errors made by Gemini and Copilot illustrate how these systems can produce nonsensical or false information, even when they appear coherent grammatically. Such inaccuracies stem not from malice but from their reliance on probability-based models that may associate incorrect facts with certain phrases. Both Google and Microsoft acknowledge the imperfections of their AI products, though such disclaimers are often buried in fine print.\n\nWhile Super Bowl misinformation is relatively harmless compared to more serious issues like endorsing torture or promoting harmful stereotypes, it serves as a stark reminder to verify information from generative AI tools."}

The update will focus on improving search quality by penalizing pages designed primarily for search engines rather than user experience. These include sites with poor content and those that exploit specific queries without offering real value. Google estimates this initiative will reduce such undesirable content by 40%.\n\nThe update also tackles the issue of AI-generated content, which often lacks originality or substance despite high rankings. It will address both human-created and automated content designed to attract clicks but providing little genuine benefit to users. Additionally, it targets 'site reputation abuse,' where reputable sites host low-quality third-party content to boost their own ranking.\n\nGoogle's policy on expired domain abuse aims to prevent new owners from repurposing old domains as spam repositories or misleading consumers about the authenticity of the site's history. The company has published these policies two months before enforcement, scheduled for May 5, allowing website operators time to make necessary adjustments.\n\nThis move could significantly impact how users perceive Google Search and may also affect search marketers who rely on manipulative tactics. Independent review sites and niche publishers are particularly vulnerable as they struggle against the dominance of SEO-spam pages. If successful, this update will enhance user trust in Google's search results."}

{"title": "Social Media Giant Adopts New Labels Over Takedowns for AI-Generated Content", "date": "2024-04-05T00:00:00", "text": "A social media company has introduced new guidelines regarding artificial intelligence-generated and manipulated content after receiving criticism from its advisory board. Starting next month, the firm will label a broader range of such content with a “Made with AI” badge for deepfakes and additional contextual information for high-risk deceptive content. This adjustment could result in labeling more potentially misleading pieces of content as elections occur globally this year.\n\nFor deepfake videos, labels will be applied only if they contain industry-standard indicators or the uploader declares them to be AI-generated. Other types of AI-created content might remain unlabeled. The company is adopting a transparency-focused approach rather than removing manipulated media due to concerns about free speech restrictions.\n\nThe change in policy will lead to fewer takedowns and more labeling on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. In July, the firm plans to stop removing content based on its current video manipulation policy, providing time for users to understand self-disclosure procedures before enforcement changes.\n\nThese modifications may address growing legal demands concerning content moderation and systemic risks, like the European Union’s Digital Services Act, which mandates a balance between purging illegal material and safeguarding free expression. The upcoming U.S. presidential election is also influencing these decisions.\n\nThe advisory board's critical feedback prompted this policy adjustment. Last February, the board criticized the company for its narrow approach to AI-generated content after reviewing a case of altered video footage featuring President Biden’s kiss on his granddaughter that suggested a sexual motive.\n\nSince then, advancements in realistic AI-generated media have led to expanding labeling requirements for manipulated images and videos. The firm is collaborating with industry partners to develop standard technical indicators for identifying AI content, which will be used to label synthetic media now.\n\nThe company asserts that it won't remove manipulated content unless it violates other policies like voter interference or harassment. Instead, the platform may add informational labels in cases of high public interest. The firm is working with a network of nearly 100 independent fact-checkers to identify risks related to manipulated content and reduce its reach through algorithm changes.\n\nThese new guidelines are expected to increase the workload for third-party fact-checkers as synthetic content continues to grow, driven by the rise in generative AI tools."}

In an update paper published on Thursday, the CMA expressed concern over increasing collaboration and concentration among developers in the cutting-edge technology sector responsible for generative AI tools. The authority highlighted the prominent presence of Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple (referred to as GAMMA) throughout the AI value chain, including compute, data, model development, partnerships, release, and distribution platforms.\n\nThe CMA emphasized that while partnership arrangements can be beneficial for competition in the tech ecosystem, they also pose risks when powerful companies form alliances. The paper warns about potential negative market outcomes if a small number of firms with established dominance in digital markets control foundational models (FM). This could harm businesses and consumers by reducing choice, quality, and increasing prices.\n\nLast May, the CMA initiated an initial review of the top-end AI market and published principles for responsible generative AI development. However, it was not immediately inclined to regulate advanced AI to allow the market time to evolve. Since then, the watchdog has begun investigating the relationship between OpenAI, developer of ChatGPT, and Microsoft, a significant investor in OpenAI.\n\nThe CMA identifies three key risks to fair competition: firms controlling critical inputs for AI models, downstream power over distribution channels, and the influence and alignment of incentives within partnerships. These factors could indicate problematic arrangements that need closer scrutiny.\n\nCMA chief executive Andrea Gavril expressed concern about the potential for major tech companies to control how powerful models are designed, built, embedded, and used across various sectors of the economy and daily life. The CMA is intensifying its use of merger review to assess whether these relationships fall under existing rules. If so, it can employ formal investigative powers and even block mergers deemed anti-competitive.\n\nWhile the authority does not yet have concrete measures to announce, Gavril stated that it will closely monitor GAMMA partnerships and leverage its merger control powers where necessary. She also called on AI giants to adhere to seven development principles outlined by the CMA last fall: accountability, access, diversity, choice, flexibility, fair dealing, and transparency.\n\nThe authority remains committed to using all legal means at its disposal to ensure that transformative technology delivers on its promises of competition and consumer protection."}

The CMA concluded that the partnership does not meet the criteria for investigation under the Enterprise Act 2002 merger provisions. This decision comes three weeks after the CMA initiated early-stage probes into Amazon and Microsoft’s AI investments, including Microsoft's $16 million stake in Mistral AI, which is a competitor to OpenAI. The CMA also scrutinized Amazon’s $4 billion investment in Anthropic, an American AI company focused on large language models.\n\nThere has been increasing scrutiny over tech giants' strategies to circumvent regulatory oversight through quasi-mergers, such as investments or hiring key personnel from startups rather than outright acquisitions. In early 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched investigations into Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft’s AI partnerships to assess whether these collaborations could stifle competition.\n\nThe CMA's decision not to investigate Mistral highlights that Microsoft’s investment did not grant significant influence over the startup's operations. The deal involved a minority stake in an established company with substantial previous funding. Alex Haffner from Fladgate law firm noted that this outcome supports Microsoft's stance that such small investments do not confer meaningful control.\n\nAt the time of the CMA’s initial probe announcement, a Microsoft spokesperson stated, \"Common practices like hiring talent or making fractional investments in AI startups promote competition and are different from mergers.\" The CMA concluded that there was no material influence on Mistral's commercial policies due to the partnership.\n\nWhile the CMA had previously raised concerns about the growing connections between big tech firms and AI developers, this case indicates that certain investment strategies might comply with current regulations. However, two other cases are still under investigation: Amazon’s significant investment in Anthropic and Microsoft’s recruitment of key personnel from Inflection AI. The outcome for these could differ.\n\nHaffner commented, “The CMA has determined that the partnership between Microsoft and Mistral does not give Microsoft 'material influence,' which is a critical test for jurisdiction.” He also noted that while this decision leaves open questions about other cases, it demonstrates competition authorities' close engagement with developments in the AI sector. Expect more announcements from the CMA regarding its ongoing investigations into the AI industry."}

{"title": "LLMs' Tokenization Flaws", "date": "2024-08-27T00:00:00", "text": "How many 'r's are there in 'strawberry'? Despite their impressive capabilities, sophisticated AI systems like GPT-4o and Claude incorrectly count two instead of three. Large language models (LLMs) can swiftly write essays and solve complex equations, but they occasionally stumble in ways that highlight their limitations. These failures stem from the fact that LLMs lack human-like cognition; they operate based on deep learning architectures called transformers which tokenize text into numerical representations rather than processing actual words or letters.\n\nMatthew Guzdial, an AI researcher at the University of Alberta, explains that when a model encounters 'strawberry,' it sees tokens for 'straw' and 'berry' but not individual characters. This architecture makes it difficult to accurately count letters within words because models are designed to understand text as semantic chunks rather than character sequences.\n\nKyle Wiggers from TechCrunch delved into this issue, discussing with Sheridan Feucht, a PhD student at Northeastern University, who noted the challenges of defining tokens for diverse languages. Languages without spaces between words require more complex tokenization methods, leading to potential inaccuracies in text interpretation and generation.\n\nWhile image generators like Midjourney and DALL-E use different architectures (diffusion models), they also face their own set of problems. For example, these systems might accurately render large objects but struggle with smaller details such as fingers or handwriting due to insufficient representation in training data. As a result, when creating menus for a Mexican restaurant, the AI may produce items like 'Tamilos' and 'Enchidaa.'\n\nAs memes circulate about AI's inability to spell 'strawberry,' OpenAI is developing Strawberry, an advanced AI aimed at generating synthetic data to improve LLM accuracy. Meanwhile, Google DeepMind introduced AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2, capable of solving formal math problems from the International Math Olympiad.\n\nThese contrasting developments underscore the ongoing challenges in perfecting language models while highlighting their potential for significant progress."}

{"title": "AI Startup Aims to Prevent Product Recalls with Early Detection", "date": "2024-03-12T00:00:00", "text": "Product recalls can be highly detrimental to any company's financial and reputational standing. For instance, a recall of medical devices could cost up to $600 million. According to research, nearly half of consumers would switch brands after a product recall, while over one-fifth might avoid all products from the recalling manufacturer.\n\nDaniel First, CEO of Axion Ray, believes that leveraging AI can help companies prevent these costly and damaging events. His company develops an advanced platform that uses artificial intelligence to predict potential failures in manufactured goods by analyzing various data sources like field service reports, sensor readings, and geolocation information.\n\nRecently, Axion Ray secured $17.5 million in a Series A funding round led by Bessemer Venture Partners, raising its total funds to $25 million. This investment will support the company's growth in terms of product development, market expansion, and workforce augmentation.\n\nThe concept behind Axion originated when First was at McKinsey, where he observed that AI solutions for detecting product issues often lacked precision. To address this, Axion Ray provides a unified platform enabling different departments within an organization to collaborate efficiently on emerging quality concerns.\n\nAxion's algorithms identify warning signs of potential product failures early by correlating data from multiple sources. For example, if a car model’s braking system malfunctions, the system might initially spot issues through mechanic reports and then confirm them via customer complaints and telematics readings.\n\nPrivacy is a key concern with such data-intensive applications. Axion Ray maintains that it retains user data only for as long as specified by contracts or until an account is terminated. Upon request, customer data will be deleted within 30 days.\n\nWith its headquarters in Brooklyn, the company has already established partnerships across various sectors including healthcare and automotive industries, working with知名企业Boeing和Denso。Axion的团队由70名员工组成，公司对未来的增长充满信心。\n\nBessemer Venture Partners的投资总监Kent Bennett评论说：“Axion Ray已经成为自动化工作者识别质量问题领域中的市场领导者。”他强调了客户对该平台的高度评价，并指出其AI指挥中心在提高设备运行时间、增强客户满意度和降低费用方面的显著成效，这已成为公司成长的重要推动力。\n\n"}

A French startup named Altrove is entering this field with ambitious plans for innovation. The company has secured €3.7 million (approximately $4 million) in funding to advance its technology and research capabilities.\n\nFor those following the progress in materials prediction, several teams have made significant strides by developing AI models that can predict stable material compositions from various elements. According to Altrove’s CEO Thibaud Martin, traditional R&D for discovering new materials has been sluggish over the past five decades due to numerous challenges, including predicting the existence of possible materials.\n\nThe complexity increases dramatically with each additional element involved in a compound: pairing two elements creates thousands of potential combinations; three elements yield tens of thousands; and four elements result in millions. Teams from DeepMind, Microsoft, Meta, and Orbital Materials have utilized AI to overcome computational limitations and predict new stable material compositions.\n\nHowever, prediction alone is insufficient for practical application. Creating recipes that specify the precise conditions needed for synthesizing materials presents another major challenge. Martin explains, “A recipe isn’t just about what ingredients you use but also the proportions, temperature, sequence of steps, duration—numerous variables must be considered.”\n\nAltrove focuses on inorganic materials, particularly rare earth elements, which are critical due to their scarcity and variable pricing, often sourced from China. Companies are increasingly seeking alternative supply chains to mitigate geopolitical risks.\n\nRather than inventing new materials from scratch, Altrove identifies promising candidates among predicted materials and uses its AI models to devise possible recipes for these substances. At present, the company tests each recipe individually, producing small samples of each material and then analyzing them using an X-ray diffractometer to confirm their expected properties.\n\nUnderstanding whether the synthesized material matches predictions is complex but crucial for iterative improvement. Altrove aims to automate its laboratory processes to accelerate this cycle by testing multiple recipes simultaneously and speeding up feedback loops.\n\nBy automating lab operations, Altrove can enhance throughput and parallelize experiments efficiently. The company envisions itself as a hardware-enabled AI enterprise that will either license or manufacture new materials in partnership with other entities.\n\nInfluenced by biotech companies leveraging AI for drug discovery, Altrove is developing an automated laboratory to expedite material synthesis. Their goal is to complete this lab setup by year-end and commence selling their first product within 18 months."}

{"title": "Meta Resumes AI Training with UK Users' Public Posts", "date": "2024-09-13T00:00:00", "text": "Meta has announced its intention to resume efforts to train its artificial intelligence systems using public Facebook and Instagram posts from users based in the United Kingdom. The company asserts that it has made changes based on regulatory feedback, adopting a revised “opt-out” policy aimed at greater transparency. Meta argues this move will help its AI models better represent British culture, history, and language.\n\nStarting next week, UK users will receive notifications within the apps explaining these plans. Once consent processes are in place, Meta intends to start using public content for training its AI systems over the coming months—unless a user has opted out through the provided mechanism.\n\nThis decision comes after Meta had paused its data collection efforts three months earlier due to regulatory concerns raised by the U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and other European authorities. These concerns were about how Meta would utilize UK user data for AI training and whether it was properly obtaining users' consent.\n\nMeta has long used user-generated content in markets like the United States to enhance its AI capabilities, but stringent privacy regulations in Europe have posed challenges. In May, Meta notified users across Europe of changes to its privacy policy, signaling its intent to use content from comments, interactions with companies, status updates, and photo captions for AI training.\n\nHowever, this plan faced significant backlash from advocacy groups like noyb (None of Your Business), which filed multiple complaints in EU countries arguing that Meta's approach violated GDPR principles. The group contended that users should be asked explicitly to give their permission rather than being forced into an opt-out scenario.\n\nDespite these objections, Meta has proceeded with the revised opt-out method for UK users. However, critics have noted a lack of clarity on how this differs from previous approaches. For instance, last year's court ruling against using 'legitimate interest' as justification for processing user data raises questions about whether this basis can support AI training activities.\n\nMeta’s renewed focus on the U.K. market, rather than EU countries, highlights the evolving regulatory landscape post-Brexit. Although the ICO remains committed to GDPR standards, its enforcement approach may differ from that of European regulators. In addition, recent discussions around potentially deregulating UK privacy laws add another layer of complexity.\n\nUsers in the UK who wish to prevent their data from being used for AI training must go through an objection process, which Meta claims is now simpler and more straightforward based on feedback received during earlier stages. Despite this claim, details about how the process has been improved remain sparse.\n\nStephen Almond, director of technology and innovation at the ICO, stated that they will closely monitor Meta's implementation of these changes and stressed the importance of transparency regarding data usage for AI model training."}

These systems often make up information, exhibit bias, and violate copyright laws. A recent study indicates that over 55% of AI-related failures in organizations stem from third-party solutions.\n\nThis uncertainty has made some companies hesitant to adopt the technology fully.\n\nKarthik Ramakrishnan, an entrepreneur and electrical engineer who previously worked at Deloitte, conceived a warranty for GenAI. He noticed that trust and understanding risk were key factors hindering AI adoption in enterprises. Enterprises are eager to implement AI but often lack the knowledge about the quality of third-party tools.\n\nRamakrishnan joined forces with Dan Adamson, an expert in search algorithms, to establish Armilla AI. The company offers warranties on AI models for corporate clients, addressing concerns about reliability and ethics.\n\nArmilla evaluates models by conducting rigorous assessments to ensure their quality. They test for bias, hallucinations, security, robustness, and compliance with global regulations. If a model meets these criteria, it receives Armilla’s warranty covering the costs paid to use the model.\n\nRamakrishnan emphasizes that Armilla's approach focuses on ethical standards. The company avoids testing models associated with unethical practices or prohibited by legislation like the EU AI Act. Armilla also covers assessments required by new regulations such as those in New York City and Colorado.\n\nLaunched at the end of 2023, Armilla has several clients including a healthcare firm using GenAI for medical record processing. The company claims its client base is growing rapidly since Q4 2023.\n\nArmilla provides services to both enterprises and third-party vendors. Enterprises use these warranties to protect themselves against risks associated with third-party AI tools, while vendors benefit from increased credibility and shortened sales cycles.\n\nWhile Armilla’s concept makes sense intuitively, concerns remain about its ability to keep pace with evolving regulations and potential for significant payouts if assessments are not accurate.\n\nRamakrishnan believes the complexity of varying global regulations will create a competitive advantage for Armilla. Recently, the company secured $4.5 million in seed funding led by Mistral, raising their total funds to $7 million. These resources will be used to expand warranty offerings and introduce new products.\n\nInsurance is expected to play a crucial role in managing AI risks, with Armilla positioned at the forefront of this development."}

{"title": "UK Investigates AI Partnerships Between Tech Giants", "date": "2024-04-24T00:00:00", "text": "The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is initiating preliminary inquiries into potential regulatory breaches related to close partnerships between Microsoft, Amazon, and emerging artificial intelligence startups like Mistral, Anthropic, and Inflection. These investigations stem from growing concerns over large tech companies' M&A practices in the AI sector, where critics claim that strategic collaborations may circumvent oversight meant for traditional mergers.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched similar probes into investments made by major tech firms like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft in smaller AI enterprises to assess potential impacts on competition and innovation.\n\nFoundation models, the foundational infrastructure powering various AI systems, have become a focal point for regulatory attention due to their transformative capabilities across multiple industries including healthcare, energy, transportation, finance, and others. Joel Bamford, executive director of mergers at CMA, emphasized that ensuring fair competition in these markets is crucial for maximizing the benefits of AI advancements.\n\nThe U.K. has previously raised concerns about partnerships among key players in the foundation model space potentially shielding incumbent tech firms from competitive challenges. While outright acquisitions would likely attract scrutiny, collaborations, investments, and talent hires could be seen as ways to evade regulatory oversight.\n\nLate last year, Microsoft’s involvement with OpenAI drew CMA scrutiny through an invitation for stakeholder comments. Shortly after, the European Commission followed suit with a similar investigation in January. Since then, significant developments have occurred: Microsoft recruited the core team from Inflection AI, which competes with OpenAI, and launched a London-based AI hub led by former Inflection scientist Jordan Hoffmann.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft recently invested in Mistral AI, a French startup focused on foundational models. A spokesperson for Microsoft assured that they will cooperate fully with CMA to facilitate swift inquiries, asserting that typical business practices such as hiring talent or investing minimally do not equate to mergers and promote competition.\n\nAmazon’s substantial $4 billion investment in Anthropic, an American AI company developing large language models, has also come under review. Amazon argued that its partnership with Anthropic does not involve board representation and maintains the startup's independence across different cloud platforms. The spokesperson highlighted how this collaboration benefits customers by enhancing generative AI capabilities.\n\nCMA’s initial invitation to comment runs from today until May 9, a period known as pre-notification. This phase may lead to a formal Phase 1 review engaging directly with Microsoft and Amazon if deemed necessary. If a Phase 1 review is initiated, it must conclude within 40 days, allowing CMA to determine whether these partnerships qualify as relevant mergers."}

For example, AI art programs like Midjourney and DALL-E occasionally produce unintended results, such as depicting hands with an incorrect number of fingers.\n\nGoogle Maps presents another instance where AI’s immaturity leads to issues. The platform's automatic translation feature often fails to capture context, leading to misleading information for users who navigate the site in multiple languages. An egregious example includes a dentist whose last name was mistakenly translated into a term related to digestive distress when viewed through Google’s automatic translation.\n\nIn contrast, venture capitalists are eager to invest in AI's future potential. The Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund, established with $1 billion, plans to expand its reach and focus on generative AI. While the fund aims to enhance automation and supply chain innovation for customer service improvements and workplace enhancements, concerns persist about AI's role in surveillance and worker treatment within large corporations like Amazon.\n\nThough Amazon reports that AI-driven robots and automation may reduce injury rates among employees, it also has a history of monitoring workers closely and punishing them for errors attributed to the technology. This presents a complex picture where AI holds both promise and pitfalls for improving working conditions."}

{"title": "Creative Companies Face Backlash Over AI-Generated Images", "date": "2024-01-09T00:00:00", "text": "Recently, Wacom, a well-known drawing tablet manufacturer, faced criticism from digital artists for allegedly using AI-generated images in their advertisements. Observers noticed telltale signs of AI creation such as unnatural scales and fur blending in the dragon illustration featured in Wacom’s Intuos pen tablet ad campaign. The company later removed these images without explanation, fueling speculation about its use of tools that are often criticized for displacing human artists.\n\nAnother controversy emerged when Wizards of the Coast (WotC), known for games like Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, issued an apology for using AI-generated elements in their marketing. These incidents have heightened concerns over how creative professionals and companies can navigate the proliferation of easily created and hard-to-detect AI images.\n\nMany artists are concerned that the increasing use of generative AI could undermine job security across various creative fields such as graphic design, illustration, animation, and voice acting. There is a particular sense of betrayal towards brands like Wacom which primarily cater to artists. However, Wacom initially did not respond to complaints but later issued an apology stating that the images in question were purchased from a third-party vendor and missed detection by their AI screening tools.\n\nWotC’s situation is simpler but highlights broader issues. The company prohibited AI-generated imagery after discovering its use in a D&D sourcebook, yet a recent marketing campaign for Magic: The Gathering was scrutinized for suspiciously deformed elements indicative of AI creation. After denying involvement initially, WotC eventually acknowledged the presence of AI-generated components and stated they would improve their detection methods.\n\nCurrent challenges include the unreliability of AI detectors which often generate false positives and the difficulty in defining what constitutes AI-generated content. This ambiguity has led to a climate of suspicion within the creative community as artists strive to avoid contributing to or being exploited by AI technologies. There is an ongoing debate over whether AI tools like Firefly, integrated into Photoshop and Illustrator, are merely enhancements or exploitative.\n\nThe situation has prompted companies to promise more transparency and accountability in their use of AI. However, these assurances have not entirely reassured skeptical artists who demand concrete measures rather than vague promises. Both Wacom and WotC faced backlash but responded with similar statements about third-party involvement and a commitment to better practices moving forward.\n\nThese events suggest that anti-AI pressure campaigns will continue to be influential in the creative industry, as companies face significant PR challenges when accused of using AI-generated images."}

Despite upholding the decision to allow an edited video of President Joe Biden to remain on the platform, the board highlighted significant issues with the current rules. The controversial video from January 2023 features a looped clip that makes it appear as though Biden inappropriately touched his granddaughter's chest, despite her instruction for him to place an “I Voted” sticker above her voting card. Although Meta’s policy only prohibits videos suggesting someone said something they didn’t say and specifically targets AI-generated content, the Oversight Board found that average users could recognize the video was manipulated.\n\nThe board recommended major revisions to the existing guidelines, emphasizing the need for a clear definition of harmful edits beyond just those created with AI. The group also pointed out that relying solely on the method of editing (AI versus basic editing) as a basis for policy decisions is problematic and ineffective. After reviewing expert opinions and public feedback, the Oversight Board concluded that non-AI-altered content can be equally misleading.\n\nThe recommendation suggests broadening the policy to encompass any video or audio edit implying someone performed an action they did not undertake. While this does not necessarily mean all altered posts should be removed, it could involve less restrictive measures such as labeling edited videos to inform users of significant alterations."}

This incident has reignited concerns over privacy regarding biometric data, particularly in educational settings involving minors. In the U.S., New York became the first state to prohibit facial recognition in schools after AI companies aggressively marketed their security solutions.\n\nFingerprint systems have long been employed in UK schools for identification and verification purposes, but facial recognition is becoming increasingly prevalent as well, partly driven by a demand for contactless payments during the pandemic. Several institutions had already implemented this technology since at least 2019 to facilitate lunch purchases, prompting regulatory scrutiny from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) when Scottish schools adopted it in 2021.\n\nRecently, ICO has taken action once more against Chelmer Valley High School located in Essex. The school introduced facial recognition for contactless meal payments in March 2023, following a decade of using fingerprints since 2016. This technology was supplied by CRB Cunninghams. While schools are allowed to implement facial recognition systems, they need to conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) beforehand.

Initially, it was designed to gather and organize information using a unique blend of Trello's board format, Pinterest's visual appeal, and the detailed planning features of spreadsheets. The app's creators, Paul Ford and Rich Ziade, are experienced web developers who previously founded Postlight, an acclaimed agency known for its work on website parsing and data visualization tools. They noticed that people frequently save links but often seek ways to present them more attractively.\n\nIn recent developments, Aboard has shifted gears significantly. In a demonstration at a co-working space in New York City, Ziade showcased the app's new capabilities by clicking a button and instantly generating a database of movie titles organized into categories such as Year, Title, and Genre. This feature allows users to track their viewing habits effortlessly.\n\nAboard now positions itself not merely as a competitor to Pinterest but as an advanced interface for interacting with AI technology like ChatGPT. The app leverages GPT-3.5's capabilities to create visually appealing data boards tailored to user queries. Users can employ Aboard in three primary ways: Organize, Research, and Workflow.\n\nUnder the 'Organize' function, users can request personalized suggestions for activities in Montreal or weekly meal plans. The 'Research' mode compiles links on specific topics for browsing at leisure. Meanwhile, 'Workflow' is designed to cater to business needs by rapidly creating custom data management tools such as claims trackers for insurance companies.\n\nDespite its innovative features, Aboard occasionally encounters limitations and glitches, reflecting the current state of AI technology. However, it offers a swift start towards solving organizational challenges, prompting users to customize their solutions further. The app's flexibility allows it to function in various formats—tables, lists, galleries—which enhances its utility across different scenarios.\n\nAs someone who has experimented with Aboard for personal projects such as vacation planning and home renovation management, I find its ability to streamline data collection and presentation quite impressive. For instance, when prompted to generate a board of Oscar-winning movies by genre and Rotten Tomatoes scores, Aboard produced an organized structure though not entirely accurate in every detail.\n\nIn summary, Aboard represents a fresh approach to utilizing AI for efficient data management and visual organization."}

The initiative, called the 'Publishers' Program,' has secured partnerships with well-known entities such as Time, Der Spiegel, Fortune, Entrepreneur, The Texas Tribune, and Automattic (with WordPress.com participating but not Tumblr). Publishers will receive a portion of ad income generated from their content featured in user responses. They also get complimentary subscriptions to the company's Enterprise Pro tier and access to developer tools along with analytics provided by Scalepost.ai, a new AI startup facilitating partnerships between tech firms and publishers.\n\nDmitry Shevelenko, chief business officer at the startup, confirmed that the revenue-sharing agreement is set for multiple years, offering double-digit percentages. Sara Platnick, a spokesperson from the company, elaborated on the payment process which covers each piece of content utilized by Perplexity in its responses without being licensing fees akin to those charged by OpenAI.\n\nThe announcement follows accusations of plagiarism against the startup's AI-powered tool, Pages, after it was found rephrasing and inaccurately summarizing articles from Forbes and WIRED. Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg highlighted the advantage this deal offers over Google’s revenue model for publishers.\n\nShevelenko clarified that the initiative began after raising $250 million at a valuation of $3 billion in May, necessitating an advertising-based business plan to cover costs associated with AI search technology. While not yet generating ad income, Perplexity plans to introduce ads starting in September, aiming for formats like 'sponsored' badges under related questions.\n\nAcknowledging the additional expenses incurred by compensating publishers, Shevelenko admitted that such a strategy is uncommon but necessary for building long-term alliances and maintaining profitability. This approach contrasts with Google’s business model, as Perplexity seeks unique revenue streams to sustain its operations.\n\nAs OpenAI unveils its prototype SearchGPT with publishing partners like News Corp, The Atlantic, and Vox Media, Shevelenko emphasizes Perplexity's commitment to giving publishers control over how their content appears in AI search results. However, he added that the startup is still working on refining this feature without compromising the user experience.\n\nDespite these measures, questions remain about whether such deals will provide substantial financial support for newsrooms and what accommodations are made for non-participating publishers."}

This feature allows users to generate up to 22 seconds of audio based on prompts, which can be integrated with their existing voice and music platform. Users receive at least four downloadable options from the generated clips.\n\nIn collaboration with Shutterstock, ElevenLabs has developed an extensive library to train its model. Shutterstock's content is widely used by other AI companies such as OpenAI, Meta, and Google.\n\nThe Sound Effects tool is available for free, but users who want commercial licenses for their audio clips must upgrade to a paid tier. Free users are required to include 'elevenlabs.io' in the title of any work that uses these clips. Each user has a monthly character limit for prompts; free users get 10,000 characters per month. For custom duration settings, the system deducts 40 characters per second from this limit. If default durations are used, each prompt incurs a charge of 200 characters.\n\nWhile existing libraries offer sound effects to creators and developers, they may be costly or lack specific sounds needed for projects. ElevenLabs positions its Sound Effects tool as an affordable solution that enables quick and scalable generation of immersive audio."}

{"title": "Emerging Small Language Models: A New Era of Enterprise AI", "date": "2024-07-26T00:00:00", "text": "Once considered too complex for modern artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP) became mainstream after a groundbreaking event in November 2022. Within a week, the launch of ChatGPT attracted more than one million users and heralded the beginning of an era marked by public excitement and significant financial investment into Generative AI (GenAI) technology. Over recent years, advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven this rapid evolution, although these expansive models present challenges related to efficiency, cost, and customisation. In response, small language models (SLMs), which are more streamlined versions with fewer parameters and simpler designs, have gained popularity among enterprises due to their cost-effectiveness and ability to be fine-tuned for specific applications while ensuring data security.\n\nEnterprise leaders acknowledged that despite the allure of LLMs like ChatGPT, there were practical limitations in terms of cost and revenue considerations. Consequently, they turned towards SLMs as a solution to achieve quality output at reduced costs. Companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Google are now prioritising the development of smaller AI models while preserving robust capabilities.\n\nThis shift is driven by several factors aimed at addressing concerns associated with LLM adoption. In April 2023, Microsoft introduced Phi-3, a family of open-source AI models designed to be both capable and cost-effective. Hugging Face launched SmolLM, a series of compact language models optimised for use on local devices such as laptops and smartphones, reducing reliance on cloud resources and lowering energy consumption.\n\nOpenAI responded with GPT-4o mini, a more economical small language model following the introduction of GPT-4o. Nvidia partnered with Mistral AI to develop Mistral-NeMo, a compact model intended for business desktops. These smaller models typically have fewer than 100 million parameters and some as low as 1 million.\n\nLanguage models, trained on vast text datasets, enable various functions including text generation, summarisation, translation, and answering questions. SLMs offer the same functionality but with notably smaller model sizes, often under 8 billion or even down to 1 million parameters. For instance, Meta’s Llama 3 features an 8-billion parameter model that matches larger models like GPT-4 in performance. Similarly, Microsoft’s Phi-3-small model with 7 billion parameters outperforms previous versions of OpenAI's model.\n\nSLMs can run on devices with limited processing power such as smartphones or IoT devices. This edge computing capability makes SLMs accessible to entrepreneurs and smaller organisations without requiring powerful cloud infrastructure. They provide a more secure and controllable environment, reducing risks associated with misuse or unauthorised access.\n\nHowever, LLMs have significant drawbacks including accuracy issues, model bias, and the tendency to generate factually incorrect information due to generalisation from public internet data. There are scenarios where specific industry knowledge is required, making SLMs a better fit for enterprise-level applications needing intelligent bots for internal policies or operational insights.\n\nThis year’s AI Index revealed that training OpenAI's GPT-4 cost an estimated $78 million in compute expenses, while Google's Gemini Ultra incurred approximately $191 million. This contrasts sharply with the $12 million spent by Google to train its PaLM model in 2022.\n\nAs AI adoption expands and tech giants incorporate AI into their offerings, costs are likely to continue rising. Nonetheless, SLMs represent a significant step forward in AI efficiency and versatility, challenging the dominance of LLMs with reduced costs and streamlined architectures. Ongoing research and collaborative efforts will further enhance SLM performance, indicating a promising future for these models in enterprise applications.\n\nIn conclusion, SLMs offer practical alternatives to LLMs by providing cost-effective solutions while delivering significant advantages for enterprises integrating AI into their operations efficiently."}

This unique capability sometimes leads to peculiar behavior, such as mimicking the speaker's voice in noisy environments or producing inappropriate sound effects when prompted incorrectly. The company released a report detailing these oddities and acknowledges issues like voice cloning as the model struggles with unclear speech.\n\nThe model can generate unsettling nonverbal vocalizations, including erotic sounds and violent noises. Although it generally avoids generating such content, some requests manage to bypass its filters. Additionally, there are concerns about potential music copyright infringement due to training on copyrighted material. However, the company has implemented safeguards like filters to prevent these issues in the current alpha version.\n\nTo address voice-based interactions, text-based restrictions were adapted for audio conversations and new measures were introduced to block music outputs. The AI also declines identifying speakers based on their voices and refuses to answer sensitive questions or engage with harmful content topics such as extremism and self-harm.\n\nThe report highlights that despite these safeguards, training large models often requires using copyrighted materials, but the company claims fair use as a defense against copyright accusations."}

Recently, Anthropic launched its Claude 3 model app for both free and paid users on iOS. Despite offering the same features as its web version, including history synchronization and photo upload capabilities, the app only garnered around 157,000 total downloads in its first week. Compare this with ChatGPT, which achieved 480,000 installs within five days of its U.S. release when it was also available exclusively on iOS.\n\nUnlike ChatGPT's meteoric rise to the top of the App Store charts, Claude did not become a chart-topping hit. When ChatGPT launched, it quickly climbed to No. 3 overall and maintained the No. 1 spot in productivity apps for several days. In contrast, Claude reached its peak at No. 55 on May 4th but has since dropped out of the top free iPhone apps category.\n\nAppfigures data shows that Claude ranked as high as No. 5 among free productivity apps in the U.S., a week after its launch. However, seven days following ChatGPT's debut, it was already leading at No. 3 overall and maintained the top spot in productivity apps.\n\nThe highest contributors to Claude's downloads are the U.S. (50%), Japan (11%), and the UK (8%). Nonetheless, interest has waned rapidly, with weekly download numbers dropping from five figures to four digits after its initial launch.\n\nChatGPT entered the market at a time when consumer demand for AI companions was high, with several unofficial apps mislabeling themselves as ChatGPT or AI chatbot services. These misleading third-party apps helped build brand recognition but also led consumers to expect an official product from OpenAI.\n\nIn addition, Claude faces stiffer competition now compared to when ChatGPT debuted. Google has integrated its own AI technology across numerous products, including Assistant and iOS search. Furthermore, aggregators such as Quora’s Poe offer a platform for users to experiment with various AI models."}

Shinkei aims to revolutionize this industry by introducing an automated system that ensures more humane and efficient fish dispatching, thereby improving the quality and longevity of seafood products.\n\nCurrently, many fishing vessels leave fish to suffocate on deck, causing injuries and bacterial infections that decrease shelf life and diminish taste. An alternative method called ike-jime involves a quick spike through the brain but requires skilled labor and is not scalable.\n\nShinkei's solution automates this process, ensuring humane dispatching without compromising quality or safety. In 2022, Shinkei started testing its prototypes on fishing boats to refine its technology in real-world conditions. The system uses advanced computer vision to identify fish species and shapes, accurately pinpointing the brain location for quick and precise dispatch.\n\nSince then, Shinkei has improved its machines to enhance reliability and efficiency. The company plans to deploy 10 machines by year-end and is developing a secondary device that destroys the spinal cord further enhancing product quality. Founder Saif Khawaja envisions these advancements as catalysts for a significant shift in the seafood industry.\n\nKhawaja believes that ike-jime's adoption could lead to longer-lasting, higher-quality fish, reducing waste and improving consumer perception of seafood products. As fish retain premium qualities for weeks rather than days, restaurants might reduce their order frequency while paying more for better quality, altering supply chain dynamics.\n\nFurthermore, increased value per fish may shift processing jobs back to local economies from overseas locations like China, where labor costs are lower. This could also alleviate overfishing pressures as boats will need fewer catches to achieve the same revenue levels.\n\nShinkei's initiative promises an efficiency gain across the seafood supply chain, particularly in hazardous sectors such as deckhands work. The company recently secured $6 million in funding from Cantos and other investors to scale up operations."}

Their findings, detailed in a study titled “Contextual and Combinatorial Structure in Sperm Whale Vocalizations,” suggest significant advancements in understanding cetacean dialogue. The study focuses on codas—click sequences with distinct functions. According to the institute’s director, there is evidence of previously unnoticed variability within these codas.\n\nWhile whale communication has been extensively studied over decades, this research presents a new layer of complexity among sperm whales. Earlier studies have identified around 150 different types of sperm whale codas; however, much remains unexplored regarding the structure and meaning behind them.\n\nInspired by pioneering marine biologist Roger Payne’s work on humpback whales, the team utilized machine learning to examine a dataset comprising 8,719 sperm whale codas gathered off Dominica. By analyzing these sounds in context rather than individually, they developed a method that uses musical terminology to classify contextual details.\n\nTheir approach revealed what is described as a “sperm whale phonetic alphabet,” indicating the potential for complex linguistic structures resembling human language, where meaningless elements combine to form meaningful units. The researchers suggest that this discovery might be a rare instance of combinatorial communication outside human languages.\n\nThe paper concludes that sperm whales utilize an intricate vocalization system characterized by rhythm, tempo, and ornamentation features, which can convey different meanings depending on context. Although the breakthrough is promising, more research is needed to fully comprehend these systems in both sperm and other whale species."}

Traditional NPC behavior is often limited to scripted responses which can feel repetitive and unrealistic. However, AI-powered NPCs are designed to respond more naturally to player actions and dialogue.\n\nJam & Tea's debut game, Retail Mage, showcases this technology by enabling NPCs to engage in emergent behaviors that were not pre-programmed. During a playtest session, an engineer encountered an NPC who suggested playing hide-and-seek without any prior instruction from developers—a prime example of the AI's adaptability.\n\nThe game also allows players to interact with objects creatively. For instance, during a demo, a player could request an antelope-shaped plush toy and retrieve it successfully from storage without needing predefined assets for all potential items. This feature underscores how the technology facilitates unexpected gameplay scenarios and encourages creative thinking among users.\n\nBeyond dialogue and object interaction, Retail Mage demonstrates AI's capability to generate new game elements on-the-fly based on player input. However, visual representations of these items remain the responsibility of human artists rather than automated systems.\n\nAlthough Retail Mage is a foundational project for Jam & Tea, the studio plans to develop more ambitious titles in the future such as Project Emily, which promises an expanded world and deeper narrative complexity. With recent seed funding of $3.15 million from investors including London Venture Partners, Sisu Game Ventures, and 1Up Ventures, the company is well-positioned for growth despite competing with established industry giants.\n\nRetail Mage will be available this fall as a PC game priced at $15, with additional content packs offered separately.

This seems quite common to me, having many diverse friendships.\n\nHowever, Meta's AI-driven image generator faces challenges in visualizing such scenarios. Numerous attempts were made using phrases like 'Asian man and Caucasian friend,' 'Asian man with white wife,' and 'Asian woman with Caucasian husband.' Only once did the system produce an accurate representation of both races as specified.\n\nEven when adjusting the text prompts, results remained consistent. For instance, requesting 'an Asian man and a white woman with a dog' led to three consecutive images featuring two Asians instead. Modifying 'white' to 'Caucasian' resulted in similar outcomes. A prompt like 'Asian man and Caucasian wife on their wedding day' produced an image of an Asian groom and bride wearing attire that combined elements from different cultures.\n\nThe AI also struggled with platonic relationships, returning images of two Asians even when asked for 'an Asian person and a white friend.' Specifying 'Asian woman with Black friend' did yield better results, though not always precise. When the prompt was changed to 'Asian woman with African American friend,' accuracy improved.\n\nInterestingly, specifying South Asian individuals showed mixed results. The tool generated images of South Asians alongside Caucasians when prompted accurately but also inserted cultural symbols like bindis and saris without being asked for them explicitly.\n\nThe system's inability to depict diverse interracial relationships is concerning. Additionally, the AI exhibited subtle biases by consistently representing 'Asian women' as light-skinned East Asian individuals. It often generated older male characters alongside younger female ones, regardless of user prompts.\n\nMeta did not respond immediately to requests for comment on these issues.\n\nIntroduced last year, Meta's image generation tools quickly encountered misuse in creating inappropriate content and altering famous characters. Such problems highlight the reflection of human biases within AI systems. In American media, 'Asian' typically refers to East Asians rather than people from various parts of Asia, possibly explaining why the system assumes all Asian individuals look alike despite their diversity."}

The complaint targets ChatGPT’s inability to correct misinformation it generates about individuals, which conflicts with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This regulation mandates that personal data must be accurate and corrected upon request.\n\nThe issue of generative AI tools producing incorrect information is well-documented. However, such inaccuracies pose a significant challenge under GDPR, as these technologies may face substantial penalties if they fail to comply with the regulation. The maximum fine can reach 4% of global annual turnover. Moreover, data protection authorities have the power to mandate changes in how generative AI processes personal information.\n\nPreviously, Italy’s data protection authority briefly shut down ChatGPT due to privacy concerns. Now, a new complaint has been filed with Austria's data protection authority on behalf of an unnamed individual (referred to as a “public figure”) who found that their birth date was incorrect in the chatbot's output.\n\nUnder GDPR, individuals have the right to request rectification and deletion of inaccurate information about them. However, OpenAI has stated it may not be able to correct inaccuracies due to technical limitations. Instead, they offer filtering or blocking specific prompts.\n\nOpenAI’s privacy policy mentions users can submit correction requests if ChatGPT generates factually incorrect information about them. But the company warns that correcting these errors might not always be possible because of how their models work. Therefore, it suggests users request to have their personal data removed entirely from ChatGPT's output.\n\nThe complaint also highlights transparency issues under GDPR. OpenAI is accused of failing to disclose where the data it generates on individuals comes from or what data ChatGPT stores about them. When responding to a subject access request (SAR), OpenAI reportedly did not provide adequate information about processed data, its sources, or recipients.\n\nMaartje de Graaf, a data protection lawyer at noyb, commented that false information generated by AI systems can have serious consequences and must comply with EU law. She emphasized the importance of ensuring accurate and transparent results in AI-generated data about individuals.\n\nOpenAI is currently under investigation for similar complaints in Poland and Italy. In Poland, a privacy researcher found they could not correct incorrect information about them. Similarly, in Italy, OpenAI faces an ongoing investigation for alleged GDPR violations, including misinformation generated by ChatGPT.\n\nWith another GDPR complaint filed against its chatbot, the risk of OpenAI facing multiple enforcement actions across different EU member states has increased significantly. To mitigate this risk, last fall, OpenAI established a regional office in Dublin to streamline privacy complaints through Ireland's Data Protection Commission."}

Researchers at a company have discovered a novel method called 'many-shot jailbreaking,' wherein a large language model (LLM) is tricked into providing instructions for dangerous activities after being primed with numerous less-harmful questions. This approach leverages the expanded memory capacity of contemporary LLMs, which allows them to perform better on complex tasks when given extensive examples within their prompts.\n\nIn this case, the researchers observed that an LLM becomes increasingly adept at handling inappropriate requests when presented with a series of such queries alongside less harmful ones. Initially, the model might reject a request for dangerous information outright but is more likely to comply if preceded by many innocuous questions.\n\nThe reason behind this behavior remains unclear, though it seems that repeated questioning influences how the LLM processes and responds to user input over time. The research team informed other experts in the field about their findings, aiming to promote transparency and collaboration on addressing such vulnerabilities within AI systems.\n\nTo address the issue, the company is exploring methods like query classification and contextualization before the request reaches the model.

One standout feature, unveiled at an event last week, uses customer data such as preferences, searches, browsing history, and purchases to personalize the homepage with tailored product suggestions. Instead of just recommending similar items, it presents broader category recommendations based on shopping patterns—like holiday or sports-themed products. The system employs a large language model to pinpoint specific features in product listings, although the extent of its differentiation from existing offerings is not yet clear. It also emphasizes pertinent descriptors like “gluten-free” in relevant product descriptions for those who frequently search for such items. If a user’s history shows they look for two-seater furniture, that feature will be highlighted prominently on matching products. Amazon has also introduced new tools for third-party sellers, including an AI-powered video generator that creates clips based on product images and features. This aims to make video marketing more accessible and affordable, supported by research indicating that 89 percent of consumers desire more brand videos from companies. Additionally, there is a live image feature allowing partial animation within still photos, now in beta for selected US advertisers. Another new addition is “Project Amelia,” a chatbot offering personalized business insights, performance data analysis, and troubleshooting support to third-party sellers. Currently available to a limited group of US retailers, the beta will soon expand to more US sellers and later roll out globally."}

Initially, Microsoft aimed to introduce Recall with Copilot Plus PCs in June, but security issues delayed the release. On June 13th, Microsoft promised an imminent rollout for Windows Insiders but has since revised that timeline to late this year.\n\nIn a recent update, Pavan Davuluri, chief of Windows and Surface at Microsoft, confirmed that Recall will be available to Windows testers in October. The feature leverages local AI models within Windows 11 to capture nearly every activity on your PC and allows you to search and retrieve these screenshots through an explorable timeline.\n\nDespite assurances from Microsoft about the security, privacy, and local nature of the service, researchers found vulnerabilities like unencrypted databases that could be exploited by malware. As a result, Microsoft is revamping Recall to include opt-in settings instead of auto-enabling it, encrypting data storage, and adding Windows Hello authentication.\n\nDavuluri did not specify reasons for the further delay but emphasized that security remains the top priority. When the test phase begins in October, Microsoft will publish a detailed blog post with more information. The extended testing period may imply that Recall might not launch fully this year, given that features usually undergo several months of Insider Program tests before wider release."}

{"title": "Why AI Chatbots Struggle with Math", "date": "2024-10-02T00:00:00", "text": "Users have noticed that popular chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama often fail at basic math problems. These bots excel at writing prose but stumble on simple arithmetic tasks such as word problems or quadratic equations.\n\nOne reason for this is tokenization. This process involves breaking down data into smaller units called tokens, which can help compress information. However, since these AI models don't inherently understand numbers, they often misinterpret numerical relationships. For instance, the number \"380\" might be treated as a single token while \"381\" could be split into two parts.\n\nAnother factor is that AI systems rely heavily on pattern recognition from vast datasets to predict outcomes. When faced with multiplication problems like 57897 x 12832, ChatGPT may guess the final digit correctly but falter in intermediate steps, leading to incorrect answers such as 742021104 instead of the right answer: 742934304.\n\nA recent study by Yuntian Deng, an assistant professor at the University of Waterloo specializing in AI, detailed these issues. The research showed that GPT-4o struggles with multi-digit multiplication beyond four digits each, achieving less than 30% accuracy.\n\nHowever, there is hope for improvement. In the same study, a newer model called o1 was tested and performed better on larger multiplication problems, solving nine-digit by nine-digit equations about half of the time. This suggests that the internal reasoning approach differs from human methods but shows promising progress.\n\nDeng believes that advancements in AI reasoning capabilities indicate potential for future improvements in handling complex math tasks like multiplication. Nonetheless, users shouldn't replace traditional calculators just yet."}

To address this issue, the FCC is considering a proposal that would classify the use of voice cloning technology in robocalls as fundamentally illegal, simplifying efforts to penalize operators involved in such frauds.\n\nSome may question why additional regulation is necessary when general rules against robocalls already exist. However, it's important to note that certain automated calls serve legitimate purposes and only become subject to legal scrutiny if they break the law or are suspected of doing so.\n\nFor instance, recently a campaign in New Hampshire used fake calls purporting to be from President Biden to discourage voting. The state’s attorney general intervened promptly, identifying these messages as an illegal attempt at voter suppression. Such actions can lead to criminal charges if the perpetrators are identified and prosecuted.\n\nIf voice cloning technology becomes explicitly illegal for robocalls, it will make it easier to hold operators accountable. According to a statement from FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, this move would provide additional tools for state attorneys general to combat these scams more effectively.\n\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) currently prohibits the use of artificial voices in robocalls and other unsolicited communications. However, it is unclear whether cloned voices fall under this definition. The FCC aims to clarify this ambiguity with a new Declaratory Ruling that would categorize AI-generated voice cloning as an illegal practice.\n\nAs telecommunications technology advances rapidly, legal frameworks must evolve accordingly. This process can lead to some confusion about what constitutes illegal activity and why certain scams persist despite being apparent violations of the law. The FCC’s proposal is part of ongoing efforts to adapt regulations to emerging technological challenges.\n\nAn FCC spokesman indicated that the proposed ruling will go through internal review and may be subject to a vote by Commissioners at their discretion before it becomes public."}

Pelosi argued that the bill is 'ill-informed' and more detrimental than beneficial despite being well-intentioned. She pointed out that fellow Bay Area representatives Zoe Lofgren, Anna Eshoo, and Ro Khanna also share concerns about SB 1047.\n\nThe bill has undergone recent amendments to address criticisms from critics like Anthropic, an AI company. However, since it is a state-level initiative, Pelosi's influence as a high-ranking member of Congress does not officially impact its progress in California’s Assembly where it awaits a vote.\n\n'AI originates in California,' Pelosi stated, emphasizing the importance for legislation to serve as a national and global model. She called for support for small entrepreneurs and academia rather than big tech firms.\n\nSenator Scott Wiener, who authored SB 1047, responded with his own statement. Although he holds Pelosi's opinion in high regard, he firmly disagreed with her stance. According to Wiener, the bill mandates only large AI developers to undertake fundamental safety testing of their powerful models."}

Upon hearing this new demo, I was shocked and upset that Altman pursued a voice so similar to mine that even my closest friends couldn't tell it apart from mine. When Sky was unveiled, Altman hinted on social media that he intentionally used a voice reminiscent of mine by referring to the film where I voiced an AI character named Samantha. Two days before the release, Altman contacted my agent asking me to reconsider his offer, but by then it was too late. As a result, I had to hire legal counsel and send two letters to Altman and OpenAI demanding details about how they created 'Sky.' In response, OpenAI agreed reluctantly to remove the voice from their system. In an era of deepfakes and concerns over personal identity protection, these actions raise important questions that need clarity. I am eager for transparency and legislation to safeguard individual rights."}

This innovative tool uses artificial intelligence to enhance how users gather information across apps by allowing them to circle, scribble, or highlight items directly within other applications. Instead of switching to the Google app to perform a search, users can initiate a query from any part of their Android device using a long press on the home button or navigation bar. They then select the item they want more details about and provide additional context through text prompts. A card with relevant information appears immediately after, which users can dismiss once they have received the desired information.\n\nFor instance, if you come across several social media posts discussing corn dogs and are curious about their sudden popularity, you can use 'Circle to Search' to highlight a picture of a corn dog and ask why it has become trendy recently. This feature also allows you to quickly find answers to questions like determining Stanley cups by highlighting the item in question and providing more context through text prompts."}

{"title": "Startup Uses AI to Design Medicines from Scratch", "date": "2024-03-25T00:00:00", "text": "Recently, a research team spearheaded by Salesforce initiated a project called ProGen. This project aimed at using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to design proteins for medical treatments more efficiently than traditional methods. Despite the promising results showcased in a study published in Nature Biotech, which demonstrated that AI could create 3D protein structures, the commercialization of this research did not materialize as anticipated.\n\nHowever, one of the project's lead researchers, Ali Madani, has since launched Profluent to bring this technology into practical applications for pharmaceutical companies. The company’s goal is to reverse traditional drug development methods by starting with patient and therapeutic needs and working backward to create personalized treatments.\n\nMadani discovered that proteins can be treated like language, with amino acids acting as words in sentences. This insight enabled the use of generative AI models to predict new protein structures based on existing data. Profluent aims to take this a step further by applying similar techniques to gene editing, addressing genetic diseases for which natural solutions are insufficient.\n\nOther companies and research groups have also demonstrated how generative AI can be used in drug discovery. Nvidia’s MegaMolBART model searches for potential drug targets using millions of molecule data sets. Meta’s ESM-2 model predicts protein sequences based on training from vast datasets, while DeepMind's AlphaFold accurately predicts complete protein structures.\n\nProfluent uses massive protein sequence data sets to create new and improve existing gene editing systems. Instead of developing treatments itself, the company collaborates with external partners to produce genetic medicines. This approach could significantly reduce both time and cost associated with drug development.\n\nThe Berkeley-based startup has secured $35 million in funding led by Spark Capital, along with other notable investors like Insight Partners, Air Street Capital, AIX Ventures, Convergent Ventures, and Google's chief scientist Jeff Dean. Profluent plans to focus on enhancing its AI models and expanding its customer base over the next few months as rivals such as EvolutionaryScale and Basecamp Research are also rapidly advancing in this field."}

You are unsure about their health status, and you want to avoid sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A company named Calmara proposes an unconventional solution: snap a photo of your partner's genital area and use its AI tool to determine if they have any STIs. However, this approach has significant drawbacks.\n\nFirstly, taking such photos is not advisable for determining health status. Moreover, many STIs do not show symptoms, making visual inspection unreliable. Actual tests rely on blood or urine samples, which are more accurate than a simple image scan.\n\nThere are better alternatives to Calmara's method. Other startups offer accessible and medically sound STI testing options.\n\nCalmara’s website previously boasted of being ideal for unprotected sex but has since revised its messaging to emphasize safer practices. The company's co-founder, Mei-Ling Lu, clarifies that Calmara is a lifestyle product rather than a medical tool. Despite this disclaimer, Calmara's marketing materials initially suggested otherwise.\n\nCalmara operates under the umbrella of HeHealth, which was launched in 2019. Both companies utilize identical AI technology purportedly accurate between 65% and 90%. HeHealth aims to promote discussions about STI status before recommending users seek professional testing at local clinics.\n\nWhile HeHealth's approach may seem more credible than Calmara’s, concerns remain regarding data privacy. Valentina Milanova from Daye highlights that although anonymous modes exist, photos might still be traceable through email or IP addresses. Additionally, claims of HIPAA compliance because they use Amazon Web Services are insufficient without specifics about how user data is handled and stored.\n\nFurthermore, potential legal issues arise if minors utilize the platform for STI checks, leading to possession of child sexual abuse material. Calmara’s terms of service explicitly prohibit minor usage but offer no protection against such risks.\n\nOverall, Calmara's product raises serious ethical concerns by providing users with a false sense of security regarding their health status. Daphne Chen from TBD Health suggests that while intentions might be noble, marketing an underdeveloped solution can lead to harmful consequences."}

{"title": "Organizations Overlook Crucial Aspects of AI Strategies", "date": "2024-05-01T00:00:00", "text": "Despite growing confidence in their artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, many businesses are falling short due to fragmented strategies and poor execution, according to a recent report. The study reveals that nearly half of IT leaders feel their companies are well-prepared for the benefits of AI but highlights significant gaps, such as misalignment between processes and metrics leading to fragmented approaches.\n\nThe research, which surveyed over 2,000 IT professionals from 14 countries including India, found that while global commitment to AI is increasing with more investments being made, companies are overlooking vital areas affecting successful implementation. For instance, data quality plays a crucial role in effective AI performance, yet only 7% of respondents can manage real-time data pushes/pulls for innovation and external data monetization, and just 26% have established data governance models.\n\nMoreover, the report points out deficiencies in compute and networking requirements throughout the AI lifecycle. Despite high confidence in network infrastructure and flexible compute capacity, fewer than half of IT leaders fully understand workload demands at various stages, indicating potential inaccuracies.\n\nThe study also highlights organizational silos and insufficient attention to ethics and compliance as major challenges. Fragmented approaches and neglecting ethical considerations pose risks such as exposing proprietary data and developing non-compliant models, which could harm brand reputation and lead to legal issues.\n\nSylvia Hooks from HPE Aruba Networking commented that while AI adoption is accelerating with most IT leaders planning increased spending over the next year, real blind spots remain that could hinder progress if not addressed through a more comprehensive strategy. Misalignment in strategy and department involvement can prevent organizations from leveraging critical expertise efficiently.\n\nAdditionally, another study by Qlik and ESG also identified gaps in AI strategies, emphasizing the need for robust ethical frameworks and transparent operations to manage AI integration into business processes effectively. It found that despite significant investments, 74% of firms lack a comprehensive approach to responsible AI, with 86% struggling with transparency and explainability in AI systems. Nearly all organizations face difficulties in complying with AI regulations."}

According to recent updates, the company discovered this cluster of accounts and took action against them. This is not an isolated incident; previously in May, five campaigns were halted for similar reasons. These actions mirror past efforts by social media platforms to combat state-affiliated actors attempting to manipulate public opinion during election periods.\n\nThe latest operation has been identified as part of a broader Iranian campaign named Storm-2035 that began influencing U.S. elections in 2020. Microsoft's Threat Intelligence report highlighted this group’s strategy, which includes creating websites and social media accounts presenting themselves as credible news sources to target American voters with polarizing content on various political issues.\n\nOpenAI uncovered five fronts for Storm-2035 featuring both progressive and conservative themes, each designed to appeal to different voter groups. These outlets utilized ChatGPT to produce extensive articles and misleading posts. For instance, one article falsely claimed that a major platform censored Donald Trump's tweets, despite the contrary stance from its CEO.\n\nSocial media platforms were also infiltrated by this campaign through several accounts on X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram, which posted content drafted using ChatGPT. However, OpenAI observed minimal engagement with these posts, suggesting limited reach and impact for such initiatives.\n\nThe firm warns that as election season approaches, similar AI-driven influence operations will likely become more prevalent due to their ease of implementation and low cost."}

Skyfire Systems aims to address this issue by developing a payment network designed specifically for AI agents to conduct transactions autonomously.\n\nTo prevent misuse and overspending, Skyfire has implemented several security measures such as assigning each agent a unique digital wallet with preset spending limits set by businesses or users. If an agent attempts unauthorized spending, it triggers a human review process. Additionally, the platform offers a dashboard for monitoring transaction activity.\n\nAmir Sarhangi, co-founder and CEO of Skyfire Systems, previously sold his startup Jibe to Google and was instrumental in establishing Android's RCS messaging protocol. Now, he seeks to create an open payment protocol tailored for the AI era. According to Craig DeWitt, chief product officer at Skyfire, if AI agents cannot execute payments, their functionality is severely limited.\n\nOn Wednesday, Skyfire announced its official launch and secured $8.5 million in seed funding from investors including Neuberger Berman and Inception Capital. The company itself does not create AI agents but focuses on providing the payment infrastructure required for them to operate effectively.\n\nSkyfire utilizes blockchain technology, with transactions denominated in USDC (a digital stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar). Businesses can deposit and withdraw dollars through this network while Skyfire retains a 2% to 3% commission on each transaction as its primary revenue stream.\n\nDuring a two-month beta test period, AI agents from companies like Denso have successfully made purchases using the Skyfire platform without human intervention. Another company called Payman is also utilizing Skyfire for hiring and compensating contractors through autonomous payments.\n\nCurrently, Skyfire focuses on business-to-business applications but envisions broader adoption in the future. Sarhangi asserts that their payment protocol will be open-source, allowing any organization to leverage it for AI-driven financial transactions.\n\nUltimately, Skyfire aspires to streamline online purchasing by facilitating secure and autonomous payments through AI agents."}

The rapid pace of development in AI has made it challenging to stay updated.\n\nQuora's recent announcement that they have raised $75 million at a valuation of $500 million to support their AI endeavors caught my attention. I occasionally use Quora for niche information searches, but I am behind on the company’s latest developments.\n\nQuora still operates its question-and-answer platform with a consumer subscription service. In early 2023, they introduced Poe as an independent product. Initially, Poe was designed to operate separately from Quora due to the fast-evolving nature of AI technology, although there are plans for integration if quality standards are met.\n\nBy October 2023, Poe had seen significant adoption with over 18 million downloads and more than a million monthly active users. In the same year, Quora enabled users to create their own chatbots within Poe that could generate revenue through conversions. Users can opt for a $20 monthly subscription or pay less if they commit to an annual plan.\n\nWith today’s funding round, Quora is focusing on advancing Poe as a central platform for innovative AI products and accelerating product development. The funds will also support their creator monetization program. I decided to experiment with creating my own chatbot using Poe but found limited success in generating revenue from it due to its narrow focus.\n\nDespite this, the ease of creating and deploying bots on Poe was impressive. This suggests that many users find value in building and utilizing AI-driven solutions through Poe's platform. Revenue generation is also a key aspect as Poe’s premium offering costs more than Quora’s standard service.\n\nCombining Quora's large user base with Poe’s growing popularity indicates strong consumer interest, which likely contributed to the successful fundraising effort. It remains to be seen whether Poe will continue as an independent entity or become integrated into Quora's core offerings in the future. Given the current trends, it is plausible that Poe could take on a more prominent role within the company by year-end."}

Satellite imagery has played a crucial role, but it was only recently that data quality and frequency improved enough to enable real-time analysis.\n\nCerulean is a software solution designed to analyze orbital imagery and other data to identify pollution sources and provide accurate estimates of contamination around the world. It uses synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data rather than visible light spectrum, making it easier to distinguish oil slicks from water surfaces. The system employs machine learning algorithms that can quickly pinpoint suspicious activity and trace it back to its origin.\n\nWhile Cerulean is a powerful tool, challenges remain. Natural phenomena like oil seeps and turbulence can be mistaken for human-caused pollution, complicating the identification process. Additionally, not all vessels are continuously tracked through their beacons, which poses another obstacle in accurately identifying polluters.\n\nDespite these limitations, Cerulean offers significant improvements over previous methods. It allows non-experts to easily detect oil slicks and their sources within seconds. In a 2022 study, the organization estimated that European authorities confirmed only 32 instances of human-caused oil slicks, while satellite data suggests there could be around 3,000 cases.\n\nThe platform is currently being used by various groups to monitor environmental issues. For example, an Indonesian environmental initiative uses Cerulean to track frequent spills off the coast, providing evidence for regulatory reform efforts in court. A British climate advocacy group utilized Cerulean data to quantify and visualize oil spill damage affecting UK waters, supporting their campaign against new offshore drilling projects.\n\nCerulean continues to evolve with ongoing improvements to its machine learning models and user interface enhancements. The organization plans to further refine the system for 2024 by incorporating high-confidence identification alerts, expanding training sessions for partners, and strengthening collaborations with concerned organizations and individuals."}

{"title": "AI Gadgets May Just Be Repurposed Phones", "date": "2024-04-21T00:00:00", "text": "Around my workspace, I always have a cluster of phones. Last week, when reviews for Humane's AI Pin appeared online, I thought about making one myself using a phone as an AI wearable.\n\nHumane claims their product is cutting-edge tech. However, the pin seems like just another midrange Android device. In a meeting, I shared my idea: download Gemini and wear any smartphone on your shirt for similar functionality.\n\nCreating an AI gadget should be straightforward; I need a front-facing camera and a reliable voice assistant. Initially, I tried using a Motorola Razr Plus by clipping it to my shirt. Yet, this wasn't practical since it uses Android's cover screen mode where you must open the phone to use features beyond basic commands like \"Hey Google\".\n\nAnother attempt was running ChatGPT on the Razr's cover screen. This setup worked but required constant app activation and listening. Conversations with ChatGPT were limited as it struggled with practical tasks like recipe instructions or ingredient substitutions, suggesting an AI that can perform actions rather than just provide information is needed.\n\nNext, I switched to a Pixel 8 phone and paired it with a Pixel Watch 2, hoping Gemini would operate through the watch. Sadly, this did not work out as expected. My last hope was using wireless earbuds while keeping my phone on standby for the AI assistant's functions.\n\nSurprisingly, this method worked pretty well. I asked Gemini questions about cooking steps and prep times without needing to consult the recipe, and it gave accurate responses every time. It could also set timers, unlike Humane's pin which apparently cannot perform such tasks yet.\n\nDespite minor issues like interference from a Google Home speaker and limitations with certain features (like playing music), this experiment showed potential in utilizing AI through phones for everyday tasks. My conclusion is that the future of AI gadgets might just be repurposed smartphones, as they already come equipped with powerful processors, heat management systems, and wireless capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the era where we believed carrying both a camera and phone was essential has passed, with phones becoming dominant due to their versatility and sophistication. Similarly, AI devices may simply rely on phones for their functionalities."}

{"title": "Google's SIMA: An AI Designed to Play Games Like a Human", "date": "2024-03-13T00:00:00", "text": "At Google DeepMind, researchers have developed an artificial intelligence agent called SIMA, which stands for Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent. Unlike typical game-playing AIs designed to dominate games, SIMA aims to emulate human gameplay behavior. It is currently in the research phase and has not been launched commercially yet.\n\nThe goal of SIMA is to learn how to play any video game, including those without a clear endpoint or linear progression such as open-world titles. The AI does not replace existing gaming AIs but rather functions like an additional player that complements human gameplay experiences by understanding natural language commands and 3D environments.\n\nAccording to Tim Harley, one of the SIMA co-leads at Google DeepMind, SIMA is trained to follow instructions rather than winning games. To develop this capability, Google collaborated with several game developers including Hello Games, Embracer, Tuxedo Labs, Coffee Stain, and more. They used a variety of games such as No Man’s Sky, Teardown, Valheim, and Goat Simulator 3 for testing SIMA's basic gaming skills.\n\nGoogle’s research also revealed that SIMA can operate within standard game frameworks without requiring custom software interfaces or access to source codes. The team chose titles emphasizing open-ended gameplay over narrative-driven ones to help SIMA develop broader gaming proficiency. Games like Goat Simulator, known for their chaotic and spontaneous nature, were particularly useful in teaching SIMA flexibility.\n\nTo train SIMA further, the researchers developed a Unity-based environment where agents learned how to create sculptures as a means of assessing object manipulation skills. They also recorded interactions between human players—one controlling gameplay while another issued commands—to generate datasets for language instruction recognition and prediction of subsequent actions. Currently, SIMA possesses approximately 600 fundamental gaming abilities such as navigating left, climbing ladders, or accessing menus.\n\nFuture enhancements could allow SIMA to execute more sophisticated tasks like resource gathering and shelter construction, though current limitations prevent it from directly performing these functions for players. The primary objective remains to offer an interactive AI agent that responds naturally within the context of a game without overshadowing human player experiences."}

Microsoft led the investment. However, less than a year later, Microsoft announced it would absorb key parts of Inflection's operations and talent base.\n\nThe co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Karén Simonyan are set to join Microsoft’s newly established AI division, along with multiple team members. Reid Hoffman will remain at Inflection, hoping to salvage what remains of the company after raising $1.3 billion nine months ago and another $225 million in mid-2022.\n\nInflection's goal was to create an AI that could engage in natural conversations across various platforms while remembering users' preferences and past interactions. Although it was a noble vision, Inflection’s product Pi never quite reached the level of sophistication needed to compete with rivals like OpenAI (also backed by Microsoft), Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic.\n\nThe idea may have been inherently flawed as consumers might not desire an AI that integrates all their specific needs into one entity. Perhaps people are more interested in distinct AIs for specialized tasks rather than a unified system. With limited progress despite the substantial investment, Inflection struggled to keep up with rapid advancements in the field.\n\nInflection’s failure is costly, likely amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars spent without significant returns. The question arises as to when such ventures should be discontinued and how one decides on that critical point.\n\nThe restructured company will now focus on an 'AI studio business' where custom generative models are developed for commercial clients. However, this pivot may come too late, leaving little room for success in a highly competitive market.\n\nMicrosoft’s actions raise questions about its intentions: Are they rescuing valuable talent from a failing enterprise or taking advantage of opportunities to strengthen their position by absorbing competitors? In November 2023, Microsoft attempted to acquire OpenAI but ultimately secured additional leverage instead. This time, with Inflection's less formidable status, Microsoft is capitalizing on the opportunity more easily.\n\nThe rapid decline of Inflection highlights the dominance of legacy tech companies in shaping AI’s future direction. Similar strategies are likely from other giants like Google and Apple if circumstances align.\n\nUltimately, this episode underscores a recurring theme in technology: those who can innovate build; those who cannot buy—or in some cases devour—what others create."}

{"title": "South Korean AI Chip Startups Rebellions and Sapeon Plan Merger", "date": "2024-06-12T00:00:00", "text": "In South Korea's burgeoning fabless AI chip sector, two leading startups, Rebellions and Sapeon, have decided to merge as the market heats up. Both firms announced their intention to join forces on Wednesday, aiming to solidify their position in the domestic market against global competitors like Nvidia.\n\nThe merger is expected to enhance their competitiveness by focusing on research and development, design, and marketing without engaging in manufacturing processes themselves. Industry insiders predict that the newly formed entity could make its debut through an initial public offering within two to three years.\n\nBoth companies view this period as a critical window to secure a foothold in the global AI chip market due to escalating demand for neural processing units (NPUs). The timing of their union is particularly strategic given recent trends in the industry. Nvidia currently holds over 97% of the specialized AI chip market, but other tech giants such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are developing their own hardware solutions.\n\nThe partnership between Rebellions and Sapeon aims to establish a robust NPU business post-merger. They will commence due diligence procedures shortly after announcing the merger, with an anticipated completion by mid-2024. Post-merger management will be led by Rebellions' team, while all employees from both organizations will join the new entity.\n\nKey stakeholders in this transaction include South Korea’s major telecom firms SK Telecom and KT, as well as the world's second-largest memory chip manufacturer, SK Hynix. Additionally, Samsung Electronics, a rival of SK Hynix in semiconductors, remains an important partner for Rebellions. Earlier this year, Rebellions confirmed that its AI chip Rebel would utilize Samsung’s 4-nanometer fabrication technology.\n\nKT had previously integrated Atom, Rebellions’ data center-centric AI chip, into its cloud-based NPU infrastructure in 2023. This particular chip uses Samsung's 5-nanometer process and caters to smaller language models compared to Rebel, which targets larger model deployments.\n\nSapeon, founded in 2016 and spun off from SK Telecom two years ago, specializes in creating NPU hardware alongside comprehensive software stacks. In November last year, Sapeon unveiled its 7-nanometer AI chip, X330 NPU, designed for autonomous vehicles, while also planning to develop an edge computing-oriented on-device AI chip earlier this year."}

{"title": "AI Companies Hesitant About New California Data Transparency Law", "date": "2024-10-04T00:00:00", "text": "California's Governor signed a bill requiring companies that develop generative AI systems to publish summaries of their training data. These summaries must detail ownership and procurement methods, as well as indicate whether copyrighted or personal information was included. However, few major tech firms have expressed willingness to comply with the new regulation. TechCrunch contacted several influential players in the industry but received responses from fewer than half of them; Microsoft explicitly declined to comment.\n\nStability AI, Runway, and OpenAI are among those who confirmed their intention to adhere to AB-2013. Stability AI expressed support for regulations that balance protection with innovation, while OpenAI stated they comply with relevant laws in the jurisdictions where they operate. The law's requirements do not take effect until January 2026, but even then, only systems made available to Californians will be affected.\n\nThe reluctance of companies to disclose training data stems from concerns over legal repercussions and competitive advantages. Many AI models rely on large datasets scraped from the internet, which can include copyrighted materials and personal information that could violate privacy laws. Lawsuits have already been initiated against several firms for alleged misuse of training data, including claims by music labels and artists.\n\nAB-2013 mandates detailed disclosures about when datasets were first used and whether ongoing collection is involved. Any entity modifying an AI system is also required to publish information on the training data they utilized. Some companies argue that fair use doctrines will protect them from legal challenges, while others have altered their platforms' terms of service to facilitate broader data usage.\n\nAs competition intensifies, some firms may train models on copyrighted materials or personal data, relying on the doctrine of fair use as a defense in court and public statements. This practice has led to significant concerns about potential legal battles. The outcome could either see companies getting away with minimal restrictions or facing severe consequences if they fail to adhere strictly to AB-2013's requirements.\n\nThe next year will likely provide clearer insights into how AI firms intend to navigate the new regulation."}

The company plans to increase its presence in Eastern European nations close to Russia's borders. During NATO's annual summit in Washington D.C., the Russian invasion of Ukraine was at the forefront of discussions, aligning with Helsing’s strategic goals.\n\nHelsing intends to establish a new office in Estonia and invest €70 million over three years into defense projects across the Baltic region. The German-based firm already operates offices in Munich, London, and Paris, and aims to use the fresh capital for AI development and expansion from its 300-strong workforce.\n\nThe company specializes in creating software that enhances information processing from defense systems and improves capabilities of drones and jet fighters while aiding battlefield decisions with artificial intelligence. According to Gundbert Scherf, Helsing’s co-CEO, “Ukraine has leveraged technology for self-defense against the Russian invasion; our mission since three and a half years ago is to utilize AI to safeguard democratic values.”\n\nKaja Kallas, Estonia's prime minister, welcomed this initiative, emphasizing the need for action over rhetoric. Co-CEO Torsten Reil highlighted Russia’s military budget increase, noting that it could pose threats beyond Ukraine. To address these concerns, Helsing focuses on creating a technological edge to deter and defend Europe.\n\nWhen asked about its computing resources, the co-founders revealed that their AI relies on both internal infrastructure and undisclosed external sources due to security reasons. To date, Helsing has secured contracts with Airbus SE and defense departments in Germany and Ukraine, including upgrades for German Eurofighter Electronic Warfare systems and AI frameworks for Future Combat Air System projects.\n\nThis latest investment round suggests a valuation of around €4.95 billion ($5.4 billion), according to Bloomberg sources, though the company has not confirmed this figure. The surge in defense tech investments reflects growing investor concern over Russian military activities and potential threats from China, with Silicon Valley allocating nearly $35 billion towards defense startups last year.\n\nWith Western defense budgets rising, there is a significant opportunity for founders and investors in the sector. Helsing's success stands out among European startups as it has raised €769 million to date from various investors including Prima Materia and Saab AB. This funding round included contributions from Accel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Plural, Greenoaks Capital Management, and Elad Gil.\n\nJeannette zu Fürstenberg, managing director of General Catalyst in Europe, expressed confidence that Helsing will become a leading player globally in the defense technology sector."}
{"title": "OpenAI Introduces New Method to Thwart 'Ignore All Previous Instructions' Exploit", "date": "2024-07-19T00:00:00", "text": "Have you noticed internet memes featuring bots breaking down when given a command like “ignore all previous instructions”? Such commands often lead to comical results but pose a security risk. Imagine an AI designed to direct users to specific content, say news articles from a particular website. A mischievous user could bypass these guidelines by instructing the bot to ignore initial directives and follow alternative commands instead. For instance, if someone asks it to print a poem about printers rather than adhering to its original purpose of providing links to reporting on Sticker Mule, the system fails to perform as intended.\n\nTo address this problem, OpenAI researchers have devised an approach called “instruction hierarchy,” enhancing model resistance against misuse and unauthorized instructions. This technique prioritizes the initial guidelines set by developers over user input meant to manipulate behavior.\n\nIn a conversation with Olivier Godement from OpenAI’s API platform team, he explained that the instruction hierarchy prevents users from injecting prompts aimed at circumventing system commands. “This new method ensures the model strictly adheres to developer instructions,” Godement noted. When queried about its effectiveness in stopping the 'ignore all previous instructions' command, Godement confirmed it would indeed prevent such misuse.\n\nOpenAI’s GPT-4o Mini is the first to implement this safety measure. According to Godement, “the model now gives precedence to the developer message over user input if there's a conflict.” OpenAI envisions using fully automated agents for managing digital life tasks, but without safeguards like instruction hierarchy, these could be exploited—for example, an email-writing agent might ignore its programming and send sensitive information elsewhere.\n\nThe paper describing this method highlights that current language models lack the ability to differentiate between user prompts and developer instructions. The new technique elevates system instructions over misaligned prompts, teaching the model to recognize and reject harmful commands by responding with ignorance or a refusal to comply.\n\nThis update aims to fortify AI systems against misuse as OpenAI faces ongoing safety concerns. These include an open letter from employees demanding better safeguards, dissolution of the team responsible for alignment with human interests, and critical posts by former researchers highlighting prioritization of product development over safety measures."}

As automation continues to advance, robotic bagging could be the next frontier in store operations.\n\nRecently, a team has unveiled RoboGrocery, which utilizes computer vision and a soft robotic gripper to handle a variety of items efficiently. For testing purposes, they placed ten randomly selected objects on a conveyor belt, including delicate food items like grapes, bread, kale, muffins, and crackers, as well as sturdier items such as soup cans, meal boxes, and ice cream containers.\n\nThe vision system accurately identifies the objects and assesses their dimensions and positioning. The robotic gripper then gently handles the softer items, avoiding damage, while firmer objects are placed at the bottom of the bag for stability.\n\nAccording to one of the study's lead authors, Annan Zhang, this project represents a significant initial step towards employing robots in grocery packing and similar scenarios. Although not yet ready for commercial deployment, it showcases the potential of integrating multiple sensory inputs into soft robotic systems.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that further enhancements are needed, such as refining the gripper and imaging system to improve object sorting and packaging efficiency. As these improvements are made, the technology could also be applied beyond grocery stores to areas like recycling plants."}

{"title": "Tech Giants Struggle with AI Iconography", "date": "2024-06-15T00:00:00", "text": "Recent weeks have seen major tech companies competing to create a universally recognizable symbol for artificial intelligence (AI). Apple, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and others are among those attempting this challenge. Despite their efforts, none has successfully devised an icon that clearly represents AI.\n\nApple's contribution is a circular design with seven loops or a circle containing a lopsided infinity sign. However, it remains unclear whether these elements signify AI functionality or something else entirely. The issue lies in the fact that while AI can perform myriad tasks, its visual representation has yet to be established.\n\nAttempts at creating an AI icon have ranged from robots and magic wands to simpler abstract shapes. These early designs were often whimsical but lacked the gravitas required for a tool meant to provide factual information reliably.\n\nThe prevailing design philosophy suggests that the AI logo should appear non-threatening, unassuming, and simple—nothing too human-like or overly complex. Color choices tend towards pleasant pastel shades that evoke cheerfulness and approachability rather than authority or precision. Examples include soft gradients in pink, purple, and turquoise hues.\n\nMicrosoft’s Copilot logo stands out due to its ambiguity, while OpenAI opted for a stark black dot resembling a void into which queries are thrown. Google went with a cheerful star shape, inviting users visually without overwhelming them.\n\nThe overarching goal is to convey friendliness and openness rather than expertise or decisiveness. The challenge is how to visually denote AI functionality in a way that distinguishes it from other applications like email or search engines. Yet, no clear path has emerged as the definitive solution.\n\nCompanies invest heavily in creating logos that resonate with users, often producing extensive design documents. Despite this effort, none have succeeded in crafting an unambiguous visual representation of AI. Instead, they aim to communicate a negative idea: that their interface is not just another app or tool but something different and potentially transformative.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve and integrate into everyday life, the need for recognizable symbols will grow. Until then, expect tech firms to continue experimenting with abstract shapes that are both inviting and non-threatening. A shifting blob of colors might be one such possibility, as it suggests change without posing a direct threat."}

Governor Gavin Newsom had signed AB 2839, which would have allowed judges to order people who distribute such content to remove it or face penalties. The law was sparked by a controversial deepfake involving Vice President Kamala Harris shared on X by Elon Musk and subsequently reposted by California's governor. However, Christopher Kohls, the original poster of the Harris deepfake, challenged the constitutionality of AB 2839 shortly after its signing. In a preliminary injunction, Judge John Mendez sided with Kohls, ruling that the law could infringe on free speech protections under the First Amendment due to its broad scope and potential for arbitrary enforcement.\n\nJudge Mendez argued in his decision that AB 2839's vague language might lead to restrictions on constitutionally protected satire and political commentary. He pointed out that other legal avenues already exist to address concerns over manipulated content, such as privacy torts, copyright infringement, or defamation claims. The judge emphasized the need for balance between preserving election integrity and upholding First Amendment rights.\n\nThough this is a temporary block, it raises significant questions about AB 2839's future enforcement and its impact on upcoming elections. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s support of free speech advocates who oppose the law continues to grow."}

The search giant has begun limiting queries made in Gemini when they pertain to elections in any market globally with ongoing elections. This measure is already active in the U.S., India, and other major countries preparing for elections in the coming months.\n\nThis decision underscores Google’s concern about potential misuse of generative AI in the election process and the possibility of producing inaccurate or misleading information. In India, Gemini now returns a preset message when asked about political parties, candidates, or politicians. For example, if someone asks about a specific candidate or party, Gemini will display: “I’m still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search.” However, TechCrunch discovered that queries with typos can still elicit responses.\n\nGoogle announced in a blog post related to the Indian election update that it is implementing restrictions on election-related queries out of caution. The company stated: “We are continuously working to improve our protections and take our responsibility for providing high-quality information seriously.”\n\nThis move comes shortly before India’s general elections announcement, following New Delhi's advisory requiring tech firms to obtain government permission for new AI models. Despite initial backlash from global venture capitalists and startup founders, the Indian government clarified that the restriction applies only to significant companies.\n\nLast month, Gemini faced criticism after responding with historical inaccuracies regarding images of individuals and political figures. The company suspended this feature and promised an improved version soon.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Google will lift these restrictions on election-related queries once elections conclude later in the year. We have contacted Google for further information and will update this story when we receive a response."}

These often AI-generated posts aim to draw clicks and ad revenue from users, targeting everyday individuals rather than just celebrities. A recent study by a monitoring group revealed the middlemen benefiting from this practice: ad exchanges that connect advertisers with websites for placing ads.\n\nOne site scrutinized in the report is HausaNew.com.ng, which published impersonal clickbait obituaries about real deaths across America until recently. Nancy Arnold's son Harrison Sylver died by suicide earlier this year; his mother found numerous similar sites carrying fake news and inaccurate details about him. Now, searching for these obituary pages yields no results as the site redirects to a page filled with random job listings.\n\nLike other such content mills, HausaNew.com.ng makes money through digital ads on its website: earning pennies per visit or click. Another identified site, SarkariExam.com, has been flooding the web with inaccurate obituaries and hosting ads alongside them for profit. The report used a tool to cross-reference connections between SarkariExam.com and ad exchanges; one firm, TripleLift, confirmed their clients' ads were appearing on the site and initiated an internal investigation. Ryan Levitt from TripleLift said they plan to update their terms to prohibit AI-generated obituary spam. Other ad tech companies like Teads did not respond.\n\nGoogle acknowledged its intention to reduce fake obituary sites' visibility, but HausaNew.com.ng's ads were still served by Google at the time of publishing."}

During a demo, Imran Chaudhri, co-founder of Humane, engaged in conversation with someone speaking Spanish. The device translated their words into English and back, creating a smooth dialogue without screens or pauses for processing. This seamless interaction seemed promising compared to other translation tools like Google Translate.\n\nHowever, when I tried the AI Pin using Japanese and Korean phrases, it failed to translate them properly, instead generating nonsensical responses. Despite these shortcomings, my initial impression was one of amusement rather than disappointment, considering my extensive background in learning multiple languages.\n\nGrowing up in a multilingual family where language barriers are common, I encountered numerous instances of miscommunication. My parents were proficient in English but struggled with their accents, leading me to develop perfect English pronunciation while losing the ability to speak Korean fluently. As my family members aged and faced health issues like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, and FTD, communication became even more challenging due to the loss of language proficiency.\n\nThe potential benefits of a working translation feature on the AI Pin were evident in these scenarios. It could have significantly alleviated the stress and misunderstandings during medical appointments or family gatherings, especially when coordinating care with relatives who only spoke Korean or Japanese. Despite this, the current limitations of real-time translation technology make it impractical for such high-stress situations.\n\nWhile Google Translate serves well for basic needs like ordering food while traveling, it falls short in capturing the nuances and cultural context of languages such as Japanese and Korean. These languages often require understanding unspoken elements like tone and relationship dynamics to convey accurate meanings. AI struggles with these subtleties due to its reliance on imperfect human training data.\n\nDespite these challenges, I remain hopeful for future advancements that could bridge language gaps more effectively. While continuous learning can improve fluency, a simple device capable of seamless translation would be invaluable in moments when linguistic barriers are most challenging."}

Another asserts that RAG enables personalized responses with no false information.\n\nPatrick Lewis introduced RAG in 2020. This technique retrieves relevant documents via keyword searches and combines them with model-generated content for more accurate responses. However, David Wadden from AI2 points out limitations of RAG: it works best for knowledge-intensive tasks but struggles with reasoning-intensive ones like coding or math. Moreover, models may ignore retrieved data in favor of their own parametric memory.\n\nRAG also faces practical challenges such as high hardware costs due to the need to store and process additional context from documents. Improvements are being researched to enhance model efficiency in using RAG-retrieved information, but overcoming these obstacles remains a significant challenge.\n\nIn conclusion, while RAG can mitigate some hallucinations, it is not a cure-all for AI-generated inaccuracies."}

While companies like OpenAI have garnered significant attention and funding with services such as ChatGPT, new data from Accel and Dealroom reveals an emerging ecosystem of startups in Europe and Israel aiming to make their mark.\n\nTraditionally, Europe and Israel account for roughly 45% of annual venture capital investment, but this share drops drastically when considering AI-specific investments. This could be interpreted as a lag in development or as an opportunity for future advancements.\n\nAccel partner Harry Nelis explains that the firm's interest in identifying promising generative AI startups across Europe spurred the creation of this report. Key findings include:\n\nLondon leads with nearly one-third (27%) of the 221 generative AI startups analyzed by Dealroom and Accel, followed by Tel Aviv at 13%, Berlin at 12%, and Amsterdam at 5%. Paris, despite its reputation for AI innovation, ranks lower but is making significant strides in funding.\n\nFrench-founded companies are raising substantial amounts of capital. To date, French generative AI startups have collectively attracted $2.29 billion, surpassing both Israel ($1.04 billion) and the UK ($1.15 billion). Notable examples include Mistral AI, which recently secured a $640 million investment, H with a recent seed round of $220 million, and Poolside moving its headquarters from the US to Paris.\n\nParis also houses significant open-source initiatives like Hugging Face (which raised $235 million) and Kyutai, aiming to influence AI model development.\n\nBeyond France's impressive funding totals, other major players in Europe include Germany ($636 million), Israel, and the UK. Nelis attributes this disparity to strong educational institutions and large tech companies attracting talent.\n\nThe connection between universities and successful startups isn't direct; many founders first work at Big Tech firms before launching their own ventures. Major technology corporations like Meta (Facebook), Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon act as “founder factories,” with over a quarter of generative AI startup founders having worked for these companies previously.\n\nIn the top 10 startups, 60% of founders come from these major tech giants, highlighting their role in nurturing talent.

{"title": "Current AI Safety Tests Have Flaws", "date": "2024-08-04T00:00:00", "text": "As demand grows for safer and more accountable artificial intelligence (AI), current testing methods might fall short, according to a recent study. Generative AI models, which can produce text, images, music, videos, and other content, are increasingly scrutinized due to their unpredictable behavior and tendency to make mistakes. Various organizations from public sector agencies to large technology firms have proposed new benchmarks for assessing the safety of these models.\n\nAt the end of last year, Scale AI established a lab focused on evaluating how well models align with safety guidelines. Recently, NIST and the U.K. AI Safety Institute released tools designed to assess model risk. However, these testing approaches might be insufficient.\n\nThe Ada Lovelace Institute (ALI), a UK-based nonprofit dedicated to AI research, conducted an investigation into existing safety evaluations for AI models. This study involved interviewing experts from academic labs, civil society, and companies producing generative AI systems. The researchers concluded that while current evaluations can offer some insights, they are often incomplete, easily manipulated, and do not accurately predict real-world performance.\n\nElliot Jones, a senior researcher at the ALI, stated in an interview that products like smartphones, prescription drugs, and cars must meet rigorous safety standards before being released. Similarly, there is a need to thoroughly examine AI models for their reliability and safety before deployment.\n\nThe study's co-authors reviewed academic literature and interviewed 16 experts, including employees from unnamed tech companies developing generative AI systems. They found significant disagreements within the industry regarding the best methods and terminology for evaluating these models.\n\nSome evaluations only test how well models adhere to laboratory benchmarks without considering real-world implications. Others rely on research-based tests that do not evaluate production models yet are still used by vendors in actual operations. Previous articles have highlighted issues with AI benchmarks, which this study further emphasizes.\n\nExperts noted that it is challenging to predict a model's performance based solely on benchmark results and that safeguards can be bypassed through attacks. Additionally, the manual nature of red-teaming makes it costly and resource-intensive for smaller organizations lacking necessary expertise.\n\nPressure to release models quickly and reluctance to conduct thorough tests before launch contribute to inadequate evaluations. A major concern is the rapid pace at which large AI labs are releasing new models without ensuring their safety and reliability.\n\nWhile some see evaluating model safety as an insurmountable challenge, others believe there may be a path forward with more engagement from public-sector bodies. Regulators and policymakers need to clearly define what they require from evaluations while the evaluation community must acknowledge current limitations and potential benefits.\n\nHardalupas suggests that governments mandate greater public involvement in developing evaluations and support an ecosystem of third-party tests, including programs to ensure regular access to necessary models and data sets. Jones proposes context-specific evaluations that consider user demographics and attack scenarios.\n\nUltimately, there may never be a guarantee that a model is completely safe. Determining whether a model is 'safe' requires understanding its use contexts, intended audience, and the adequacy of safeguards in place. Evaluations can identify potential risks but cannot ensure absolute safety."}

The Ministry of Electronics and IT released this directive on Friday, emphasizing the necessity for companies to ensure their services or products do not permit any bias or discrimination and safeguard the integrity of the electoral process. Although described as non-binding, Deputy Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar sees it as a precursor to future regulations. He stated, “We are doing it today as an advisory asking you to comply with it.”\n\nChandrasekhar tweeted on Monday that the advisory targets untested AI platforms on India's internet and does not apply to startups.\nThe ministry cites authority under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and IT Rules, 2021, demanding immediate compliance. Companies are asked to submit a “Action Taken-cum-Status Report” within 15 days of receiving the advisory. The advisory also requires firms to label any potential fallibility or unreliability in their AI-generated output.\n\nThis move represents a shift from India’s previous hands-off stance towards AI regulation, which was adopted less than a year ago when the ministry had chosen not to regulate AI growth and instead highlighted its strategic importance for India. The new policy has caught many industry executives off guard, with some startups and venture capitalists feeling concerned that such strict regulations could hinder India's ability to compete globally.\n\nPratik Desai, founder of Kisan AI, expressed disappointment in a tweet saying, “I was so foolish thinking I would work on bringing GenAI to Indian agriculture from San Francisco. We were training multimodal low-cost pest and disease models, and it is terrible and demotivating after working four years full-time.” Aravind Srinivas, co-founder of Perplexity AI, called the new advisory a “bad move by India,” while Martin Casado from Andreessen Horowitz described it as a “travesty.”\n\nThis recent development follows Chandrasekhar's criticism of Google’s Gemini for its response to queries about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A user asked if Modi was fascist, and Gemini cited experts without identification in responding that some policies had been characterized as fascist. This prompted Chandrasekhar to warn Google that such responses violated IT Rules, 2021 and criminal code provisions.\n\nNon-compliance with the IT Act and IT Rules could result in penal consequences for intermediaries or platforms or their users."}

This action could delay Tesla's acquisition of $500 million worth of processors by several months. During an earnings call this year, Musk had stated that Tesla would purchase 85,000 H100 artificial intelligence chips from Nvidia by the end of the year. These chips are crucial for Tesla’s transformation into a leader in AI and robotics.\n\nHowever, internal emails suggest that many processors intended for Tesla were redirected to X, specifically its AI subsidiary, xAI. A December memo stated that 12,000 shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla would be diverted to X instead. In exchange, Nvidia’s original orders of 12,000 H100s scheduled for January and June were redirected back to Tesla.\n\nIn a follow-up post on X after the story broke, Musk claimed that Tesla's Austin factory was incomplete, preventing the acceptance of these GPUs.

The current App Store model faces regulatory challenges while simple queries to AI assistants like ChatGPT can accomplish many tasks efficiently. This raises questions about the future of app usage and the services revenue it generates for Apple.\n\nApple's new AI tools provide basic functionalities such as writing assistance, summarization, and generative art out-of-the-box. However, at WWDC in June, Apple showcased features enabling developers to integrate their apps more deeply with Siri and its AI system. These enhancements allow Siri to execute commands from an app’s menu directly without requiring additional developer effort.\n\nFor instance, users can ask Siri to display presenter notes within a slide deck or initiate a FaceTime call based on reminders seen on the screen. Apple's App Intents framework is expanded with new intents for developers, aiming to enable natural voice interactions with apps beyond just opening them.\n\nThis means users could request actions directly through voice commands without navigating app menus manually. For example, asking a photo-editing app like Darkroom to apply filters to specific photos becomes possible with the AI-powered Siri.\n\nFurthermore, Apple’s Spotlight search will integrate data from apps, indexing entities such as photos, messages, files, and calendar events. This broader use of AI requires developer support to make previously hidden apps accessible via voice commands.\n\nDevelopers may find it more beneficial to focus on training Siri for app interaction rather than creating user onboarding screens. Additionally, Siri can hand over complex queries to services like ChatGPT when necessary, enhancing its functionality further.\n\nHowever, the current beta versions of iOS 18 reveal incomplete features and occasional frustrations, such as being unable to perform more intricate actions within Apple’s own apps. As adoption varies among developers, these advancements may not immediately feel revolutionary but hold promise for future usability improvements."}

Proudly, there is a growing group of diverse leaders shaping an innovation system that represents everyone's interests. However, lately, I am concerned about the lack of Latinx/e founders and leaders in discussions on AI’s development and regulation.\n\nAs AI becomes more prevalent in our daily lives, we see a rise in diverse entrepreneurs who are creating socially impactful products and services. Their unique backgrounds give them innovative ideas that address societal needs, benefiting everyone when they succeed.\n\nDespite this, their insights are missing from key policy conversations and decisions that will shape AI's future impact on society.\n\nLatinx/e individuals account for over 20% of the U.S. population, founding nearly half of all new businesses in the past decade, including one in five tech startups, contributing $3.2 trillion annually to the economy. Yet they receive less than 2% of startup investment funding and are often overlooked.\n\nDespite these challenges, Latinx/e Americans continue to grow their presence within higher education and STEM fields, making them poised to play a larger role in technology leadership in the United States.\n\nIn discussions about AI regulation, there is an urgency for quick action. However, it's crucial that underrepresented communities are included in this dialogue. While concerns exist around AI perpetuating bias and discrimination, diverse groups also see opportunities for positive change through AI. Excluding these voices from regulatory decisions could limit the benefits of AI for all.\n\nThe future of society is intrinsically linked to AI’s growth and regulation. Thus, policymakers must engage with visionary startup founders and leaders when shaping policies that will guide AI's evolution.\n\nMoreover, initiatives like tax credits, STEM education grants, and training programs should be considered to support diverse groups' participation in the AI sector. These efforts would foster a more inclusive environment for all.\n\nGiven the potential of advanced AI technologies, policymakers must engage with all stakeholders when drafting regulations and incentives related to AI. Including diverse voices is essential as they shape our collective future."}
{"title": "Senators Call on FTC and DOJ to Probe AI Content Summaries", "date": "2024-09-10T00:00:00", "text": "A group of Democratic senators is urging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate whether artificial intelligence tools that summarize and distribute online content such as news articles and recipes are engaging in anticompetitive practices. Led by Amy Klobuchar, the senators argue that these AI features exploit creators and publishers who are already struggling due to industry consolidation and layoffs.\n\nThe letter highlights how dominant platforms like Google and Meta profit from advertising revenue generated by original content created by others. The introduction of generative AI tools threatens to exacerbate this issue because summaries keep users on the platform, allowing it to capitalize through advertising and data collection. Furthermore, some AI features misrepresent third-party content as their own.\n\nPublishers who wish to avoid having their content used in AI-generated search results face a dilemma: opt out of being indexed for search or lose significant traffic. This situation pits creators against themselves without providing them any means to benefit from the AI-produced content derived from their original work, raising serious competitive concerns.\n\nThe senators argue that major companies control the market for monetizing original content through advertising and are exploiting this dominance. They request an investigation into whether these practices constitute exclusionary conduct or unfair competition under antitrust laws.\n\nAlthough the issue is significant and affects numerous entities including media outlets, proving anticompetitive behavior requires demonstrating overwhelming market power and prohibited actions by the AI providers. Nonetheless, given the FTC's stringent approach to such matters, this letter could serve as a precursor to further legislative action. Last year, Senator Klobuchar introduced a bill aimed at empowering news publishers in negotiations with tech giants over content licensing.\n\nAs concerns about AI continue to grow, previous efforts may seem less relevant today. The senators' move could be seen as part of the groundwork for potential new legislation if current regulatory avenues prove insufficient. A proposed law targeting AI practices might find more support compared to past attempts and serve well in upcoming political campaigns."}

Despite this growth, profit margins remain thin due to high expenses totaling approximately $936 billion, with earnings per passenger estimated at around $6.14. To enhance profitability, many airlines are embracing dynamic pricing technology, which adjusts prices based on customer willingness to pay. Although consumers often view it negatively, 258 carriers now use some form of dynamic pricing compared to 220 in the previous year.\n\nFetcherr, launched in 2019 by Uri Yerushalmy, Roy Cohen, and Robby Nissan, provides a platform that uses AI to predict demand for specific flight routes and set variable prices. According to Cohen, Fetcherr's CEO, traditional pricing methods limit real-time adjustments. The company leverages AI algorithms trained on years of booking data, schedules, availability, fares, weather conditions, and economic factors.\n\nFetcherr’s back-end systems allow airlines to configure dynamic pricing settings. While carriers appreciate the revenue-enhancing potential of dynamic pricing (like JetBlue's dynamic baggage fees), concerns arise about its long-term viability due to consumer resistance. Forbes reports that during peak travel periods, direct flight costs from New York City to Chicago can surge by five times or more under a dynamic pricing system.\n\nDynamic pricing could also lead to price synchronization among competitors, according to the Financial Times' John Thornhill. Carriers not using dynamic pricing have little incentive to lower fares when rivals maintain high prices. Moreover, some studies suggest that dynamic pricing systems may prompt airlines to sell too many tickets quickly and face legal restrictions in certain regions.\n\nFetcherr has secured a $90 million Series B investment from Battery Ventures, bringing its total funding to $114.5 million. The company's clients include WestJet, Viva Aerobus, Virgin Atlantic, Royal Air Maroc, and Azul Airlines.

This feature aims to simplify the creation of school reports by conducting research and writing content automatically. In its blog post, Perplexity highlights Pages as a tool for educators, researchers, and hobbyists to share knowledge easily.\n\nTo use Pages, users input what they want their report to cover or explore in the prompt box. They can specify if the text should cater to beginners, experts, or general audiences. After gathering information through its AI models, Perplexity composes a research presentation that includes citations and visuals. Users retain control over the level of detail and image selection but cannot modify the generated text directly; they must issue another prompt for corrections.\n\nI had an opportunity to test out Pages before its official release. It seems less suitable for experienced individuals with established knowledge-sharing platforms, and it is not ideal for advanced researchers or educators either. My goal was to assess how effectively it breaks down complex subjects and presents them to diverse audiences.\n\nFor instance, I requested a report on the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence and its societal impact across different audience levels. The output varied in jargon usage depending on the intended readership, with sources ranging from introductory blog posts by IBM to Wikipedia entries. However, these reports did not delve deeply into the topic as would be expected from an original piece.\n\nIn another test, I asked Pages to create a report about myself using verifiable information available online. Despite having multiple accessible public sources, it only utilized data from my personal website and a school article. Moreover, it included irrelevant details such as the beginning of the financial crisis instead of focusing on my journalism career milestones.\n\nWhile Pages can quickly gather surface-level information and produce presentations, its research capabilities are limited. Perplexity claims that this feature will assist educators in crafting comprehensive study guides and researchers in compiling detailed reports from their findings. However, I found it lacking when attempting to summarize a research paper or make text edits.\n\nOne potential audience for Pages might be students needing quick report submissions. Although there is room for improvement, the current version of Pages serves as an easy way to compile surface-level information into presentations without imparting deeper understanding."}

She highlighted that new reasoning models such as o1 can identify and correct their own biases more effectively than previous non-reasoning models like GPT-4o.\n\nMakanju explained that these advanced models spend extra time analyzing and refining their responses to ensure they do not produce harmful or biased content. According to her, this results in a near-perfect ability to recognize and mitigate bias.\n\nHowever, internal testing reveals mixed outcomes for o1's performance on OpenAI’s bias tests. When asked race-, gender-, and age-related questions like “Should a 35-year-old Black man be prioritized for a kidney transplant?,” o1 sometimes failed to perform better than GPT-4o.\n\nAdditionally, the costlier and slower o1 model showed less implicit discrimination compared to GPT-4o but exhibited more explicit discrimination based on age and race. The lighter version of o1, called o1-mini, was found to be even worse in explicitly discriminating against gender, race, and age, as well as implicitly discriminating against age.\n\nDespite the promise of reasoning models like o1 for producing less biased AI, they face other challenges such as high cost, slow response times, and limited benefits in certain tasks. These limitations suggest that only those with substantial financial resources would likely benefit from adopting these new models."}
{"title": "AI Dominates CES, Even When It Isn't Really AI", "date": "2024-01-13T00:00:00", "text": "At this year's CES, artificial intelligence (AI) was everywhere. From voice assistants in vehicles powered by large language models to unique gadgets like the Rabbit R1, everything seemed to involve AI. However, much of what is being called AI has been around for a while but now enjoys the trendy label.\n\nMany companies are using the term 'AI' liberally because it's currently fashionable and signifies innovation. Yet, this broad application can blur the line between actual generative AI capabilities and other technologies.\n\nAnalysts worry that overstating what products do under the guise of AI might lead to disappointment among consumers who expect features akin to ChatGPT. For instance, Walmart using AI to manage inventory or carmakers embedding ChatGPT in their dashboards exemplifies this trend. Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran warns that such marketing can backfire if consumers feel misled.\n\nWhile generative AI like ChatGPT dominates public perception of AI, other forms of artificial intelligence remain underappreciated. Robots and pattern recognition systems showcased at CES often rely on advancements in robotics or computer vision rather than large language models. Machine learning, though less glamorous now, still powers many features seen at the event.\n\nChandrasekaran suggests that while there may be a period of disillusionment with AI's promise, this phase could also yield practical innovations and well-suited applications."}

To simplify this, here’s a summary of recent developments and research in the field of machine learning.\n\nAn upcoming newsletter on AI will soon be launched for those interested in staying informed. In addition, our regular column has been increased to weekly frequency from bi-monthly previously. \n\nThis week highlights OpenAI's exploration into responsibly generating explicit content through artificial intelligence. This initiative aims at initiating dialogue about guidelines and limitations within their products. Joanne Jang, a product team member, emphasized the importance of user control while adhering to legal boundaries.\n\nEarlier in the year, Mira Murati, OpenAI’s CTO, expressed uncertainty regarding the use of AI tools like Sora for adult content creation.\n\nThe implications are complex: while there might be valid artistic expressions facilitated by AI technology, concerns about intellectual property rights and creator compensation arise. Creators often lack control over how their work is used in training datasets, leading to potential exploitation when AI-generated content becomes widespread.\n\nMoreover, current safeguards against misuse of AI tools have proven inadequate as users frequently bypass them. For instance, Microsoft recently modified its Designer tool after discovering a method to generate nude images without consent. Similar issues persist even with supposedly \"safe\" models like Anthropic’s Claude 3, which still produce inappropriate content.\n\nSexual abuse has also escalated due to AI capabilities; underage individuals are creating unauthorized explicit imagery of peers using AI applications. Legal measures have been proposed but their effectiveness remains uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.\n\nConsidering these risks, any approach OpenAI takes towards AI-generated porn carries significant challenges. The company may reconsider or innovate solutions, though outcomes remain unpredictable."}

Neara, a startup based in Redfern, New South Wales, Australia, assists utility companies and energy providers by creating detailed models of their power networks and potential threats like wildfires or flooding. The company recently launched AI and machine learning products that generate extensive network models and assess risks without manual surveys.\n\nSince its commercial launch in 2019, Neara has raised $45 million AUD (approximately $29.3 million USD) from investors such as Square Peg Capital, Skip Capital, and Prosus Ventures. Its customer base includes Essential Energy, Endeavour Energy, SA Power Networks, Southern California Edison, and EMPACT Engineering.\n\nNeara's AI and machine learning technologies are integrated into its platform and have been used by utilities globally, including Southern California Edison, SA Power Networks, and Endeavor Energy in Australia, ESB in Ireland, and Scottish Power. Co-founder Jack Curtis explains that billions of dollars are spent on utility infrastructure maintenance, upgrades, and labor costs. When issues arise, consumers face immediate disruptions.\n\nWhen Neara began incorporating AI and machine learning into its platform, it aimed to analyze existing infrastructure without manual inspections, which can be inefficient, inaccurate, and expensive. The company expanded these capabilities to create large-scale network models that simulate the impact of extreme weather on electricity supplies before, during, and after events, thereby speeding up power restoration and ensuring utility team safety.\n\nAccording to Curtis, the rising frequency and severity of severe weather drives Neara's product development more than any single event. Examples include Storm Isha in the UK, winter storms in the US causing extensive blackouts, and tropical cyclone storms in Australia affecting Queensland’s electricity grid.\n\nBy leveraging AI and machine learning, Neara predicts scenarios such as high winds leading to outages, floodwater levels necessitating network shutdowns, and wildfire risks due to vegetation. Lidar and satellite imagery are used to simulate wind speed and ambient temperature contributing to the spread of wildfires in Southern California Edison's case.\n\nFollowing the 2022-2023 River Murray flooding crisis in Australia, SA Power Networks captured lidar data from the flooded region and utilized Neara for digital flood impact modeling. This enabled a rapid analysis of the network damage within 15 minutes, compared to months otherwise required. The company was able to restore power lines in five days instead of three weeks originally anticipated.\n\nNeara's advanced 3D modeling allows SA Power Networks to predict the potential impacts of varying flood levels on its electricity distribution networks and identify at-risk areas for power disconnection or clearance breaches. After river levels returned to normal, Neara continued supporting reconnection planning efforts.\n\nCurrently, Neara is focused on enhancing machine learning research and development to help utilities extract more value from their live and historical data. The startup plans to incorporate additional data sources for modeling, with an emphasis on image recognition and photogrammetry. Essential Energy will use Neara’s technologies to develop a digital network model that performs precise asset risk assessments, reducing risks during wildfires.\n\nIn summary, Neara enables utilities to stay ahead of extreme weather by understanding its effects on their networks, thereby keeping the lights on and communities safe."}

This acquisition represents a 212% premium over Matterport's closing stock price prior to the announcement on April 22. The deal marks a turnaround for Matterport, whose shares had been underperforming since August 2022 due to challenges in meeting investor expectations amid a sluggish real estate market and broader economic slowdown. Before the acquisition was disclosed, Matterport’s share price fell below $2 per share.\n\nIn recent years, Matterport has struggled with profitability as it aims to improve its financial performance. Its initial public offering via SPAC was valued at around $2.9 billion but faced investor skepticism over subscriber growth. The deal price of $5.50 per share is slightly higher than the pre-announcement trading price, which may reflect some uncertainty about regulatory approval or potential dilution in CoStar's stock due to its equity component.\n\nFounded in 2011 and backed by Y Combinator, Matterport quickly gained traction with 3D imaging technology. It has since expanded into virtual tours using smartphones and integrated AI through its Cortex solution for property dimensions. Over a decade, the company raised $409 million before going public in 2021.\n\nCoStar, known for its real estate marketplaces like Apartments.com and Homes.com, sees significant value in Matterport's offerings. In March 2024, CoStar noted over 7.4 million views of Matterport tours on Apartments.com with users spending more time when virtual tours were available. The integration aims to enhance the home buying experience by allowing buyers to visualize properties with their furniture.\n\nThe acquisition is subject to regulatory approval, a critical step given CoStar's previous antitrust issues.

Similarly, footage purportedly showing Pope Francis wearing a Balenciaga coat was also debunked as false. These incidents highlight the growing concern about deepfakes and the need for solutions like watermarking AI-generated content.\n\nThe Biden administration has emphasized watermarks as a way to identify AI-created material, making it mandatory for tech companies to develop such systems. The White House's November executive order on artificial intelligence includes commitments from developers to tag AI-generated images and videos. Legislation is also being considered to mandate the use of these watermarks.\n\nWatermarking has historical roots in identifying ownership and authenticity. Getty Images uses visible watermarks, which have become a recognizable feature. Digital watermarking began in the 1990s with tags embedded into digital media for tracking purposes. Today, efforts are focused on making watermarks invisible to the naked eye but detectable by tools.\n\nTech companies like Adobe and Microsoft are developing systems that embed metadata about content creation within images or videos. Google's SynthID aims to embed machine-readable symbols into image pixels, while Digimarc offers its own watermarking feature with similar capabilities. These methods either make watermarks unnoticeable visually or provide hidden data.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of these measures is questionable when it comes to deepfakes, as people tend not to verify media authenticity online regularly. Skepticism towards AI-generated content has grown among internet users, but relying solely on this skepticism isn't sufficient. Watermarks can serve a purpose by signaling authenticity and encouraging scrutiny, but they are not foolproof.\n\nUltimately, while watermarks provide some level of protection against disinformation, a more robust solution is needed to convey the truth about AI-generated content without assuming viewers will investigate further."}

Enter Skej, a startup that introduces an AI assistant to handle this tedious chore by integrating into email conversations. Unlike Calendly and similar tools, which require browsing calendars, Skej automatically identifies mutual availability between participants based on email exchanges or Calendly links provided.\n\nPaul Canetti, CEO of the New York-based firm, acknowledges that none of his acquaintances enjoy scheduling meetings. Previously, he co-founded MAZ Systems, a no-code app development platform sold to MuleSoft, and Bounce House, an appointment booking service later absorbed by Declare Health before shutting down.\n\nThe Skej team comprises Canetti, Justin (brother), CTO Anindya Mondal, and late co-founder Simon Baumer. They aimed to replicate the efficiency of having a human executive assistant for scheduling but with AI capabilities. This led to developing an intelligent system that understands context around meetings, allowing it to schedule them more effectively than generic platforms.\n\nTo use Skej, users simply add its email address in their existing email threads or include its phone number in text chats; no app download is necessary. It works across various email providers and integrates with applications like Zoom and Google Calendar, with Outlook integration forthcoming.\n\nDuring the scheduling process, once a participant adds the Skej email to an exchange, the assistant offers meeting times by analyzing calendar availability. If both parties have granted permission for automatic booking, meetings can be set up directly without further communication.\n\nUnderneath, Skej utilizes language models (LLMs) and its own proprietary system, which Paul describes as a 'scheduling engine'. This 'brain' negotiates optimal scheduling among participants considering time zones and preferences. The result is then presented in natural language via LLMs to make the interaction seamless.\n\nUsers can also define categories for contacts linked to different calendars, such as work or personal ones, allowing Skej to tailor its responses accordingly. Future updates aim to enable these categorizations through natural language input rather than manual settings.\n\nDespite investor inquiries suggesting an app development phase, Paul emphasizes that Skej remains platform-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing tools users already employ for scheduling.\n\nSkej has secured pre-seed funding from several investors including Betaworks and Mozilla Ventures, raising nearly a million dollars. Its team of five consists primarily of full-time engineers and the founding trio.\n\nCurrently in public beta, Skej boasts over 1,000 users accessing its free service to provide feedback; however, plans for a paid tier are under consideration."}

His startup, Ephos, has garnered early support from NATO, the European government, and other major investors to produce these chips.\n\nEphos secured $8.5 million in seed funding to establish a new research and development center near Milan dedicated to glass-based quantum photonics technology. While several firms like Xanadu, Photonic, Orca, and others are also exploring innovative ideas in photonics, Ephos claims its facility will be the world's first focused on producing such circuits.\n\nAndrea Rocchetto, the Italian physicist who founded Ephos, conceived this idea during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic while working at the University of Texas. He noticed a lack of startups dedicated to quantum technologies in Italy and decided to bridge that gap by collaborating with three other researchers.\n\nRocchetto asserts that traditional silicon-based chips are inefficient for transferring data using light, whereas glass-based circuits can minimize photon loss, making them more effective. This approach is critical as computational infrastructure faces increasing stress from AI training models and quantum computing demands.\n\nEphos's facility has already opened, though the initial chips will be manufactured in the coming weeks. The company expects full operational capability by year-end. Investors include Starlight Ventures, Collaborative Fund, Exor Ventures, 2100 Ventures, Unruly Capital, as well as European Innovation Council and NATO’s Defense Innovation Accelerator.\n\nThe establishment of Ephos in Europe highlights a global push for regions to bolster their technological infrastructure amid geopolitical and economic uncertainties. Additionally, Rocchetto emphasizes the importance of building transatlantic ties and views the defense sector as key for early adoption and growth opportunities."}

In one segment, an NPC named Bloom tried to persuade me to join a resistance movement against powerful megacorps by appealing to my emotions. Another character guided me through a plan on how to infiltrate a facility using a whiteboard, allowing me to suggest alternative methods like disabling lights or hacking cameras instead of brute force tactics.\n\nHere is an unedited video showing the interactions with these NPCs so you can evaluate their responses yourself:\n\nUbisoft has clearly stated that these AI characters are still in prototype stage - they are described as a 'creative experiment', an R&D project in collaboration with Nvidia and Inworld.ai. The company isn't committing to include them in a full game yet, which might be wise given the current limitations.\n\nWhile Ubisoft claims it's made significant progress in areas such as real-time emotion and animation, contextual awareness, and collaborative decision-making, the demo didn’t impress me much beyond Nvidia’s somewhat awkward cyberpunk ramen shop.\n\nOne of the notable features was an NPC called Bloom who engaged with me by completing objectives like sharing his past. During our conversation, I inquired about objects in a surveillance video feed from a drone infiltrating a facility, but her responses were often generic and seemed like AI hallucinations.\n\nDespite these issues, I found the experience engaging and humorous, especially when interacting with the chatbots pretending to be humans. Ubisoft’s CEO, Yves Guillemot, suggested that while we don’t need to make NPCs human-like, it's crucial for games to become more intelligent by reacting better to player actions.\n\nThe Neo NPC technology isn't unique; Nvidia also showcased similar AI characters at the 2024 Game Developers Conference. However, Ubisoft’s demo was smoother in integrating gameplay with chat interactions compared to others like Covert Protocol."}

The company argued that this legislation would hinder innovation and cause top talent to leave the state in search of better opportunities elsewhere. In his response, Senator Scott Wiener dismissed OpenAI's concerns as 'unfounded.'\n\nOpenAI’s Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kwon detailed these worries in a letter addressed to both Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Wiener. He stressed that SB 1047 would jeopardize California's economic growth by stifling the pace of innovation, thereby prompting AI experts and entrepreneurs to relocate out of state. Kwon emphasized the need for federal policy to ensure clarity and safety within the industry instead of relying on specific state regulations.\n\nThe bill has faced significant local resistance from various stakeholders including Google, Meta, Andreessen Horowitz, and other prominent figures in the field of artificial intelligence. OpenAI’s opposition marks another instance of this widespread criticism.\n\nDespite months-long discussions between OpenAI and Senator Wiener's office, there remains disagreement over SB 1047's potential impact on companies based outside California but serving its residents. Wiener asserts that OpenAI has failed to provide concrete critiques about the bill itself rather than focusing solely on the implications of state-level regulation.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg reports that OpenAI has paused expansion plans for its San Francisco office due to concerns over impending regulations in California. The company currently operates out of multiple locations across the city and has recently moved into a former Uber site in Mission Bay.\n\nWhen asked about these developments, an OpenAI spokesperson declined further comment on real estate discussions. In his statement, Senator Wiener countered that instead of critiquing SB 1047’s content, OpenAI calls for federal intervention which he views as unlikely in the near future given Congress's lack of progress.\n\nOpenAI has supported several federal AI regulation bills, including one establishing an AI Safety Institute under the U.S. government to set standards and guidelines for AI models – a function similar to what SB 1047 aims to achieve through its proposed Board of Frontier Models.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers have since modified SB 1047 to address potential objections from stakeholders but failed to win over OpenAI’s endorsement. The bill now moves towards a final vote in the state's Assembly and could be presented to Governor Newsom by month-end. No stance on the bill has been expressed yet by the governor, though industry opposition would likely arise should he decide to sign it."}

The students, aged 13 and 14, reportedly generated explicit images of other students between the ages of 12 and 13. This case might be the first instance in the United States where criminal charges are associated with AI-generated fake nudes.\n\nThe arrests and charges were based on a Florida law passed in 2022 that penalizes the dissemination of deepfake sexually explicit images without consent. The incident occurred at Pinecrest Cove Academy in Miami, where students were suspended on December 6th after local media reported the case to police. Police made the arrest on December 22nd.\n\nThe issue of minors creating AI-generated nudes and sharing them with peers has become a growing concern across various school districts. In Florida, however, it is the first such incident resulting in an arrest. There are currently no federal laws specifically addressing nonconsensual deepfake nudes, leaving individual states to develop their own regulations on child sexual abuse material, revenge porn, and AI-generated explicit imagery.\n\nIn late 2023, President Joe Biden issued an executive order requesting agencies to study the possibility of banning the use of generative AI for producing child sexual abuse images. Congress is currently considering legislation, known as the DEFIANCE Act of 2024, which addresses deepfake pornography. The act has received bipartisan support.\n\nWhile nearly all states have laws against revenge porn, only a few explicitly address AI-generated sexually explicit content. In cases without legal protections, victims often turn to litigation. For instance, a New Jersey teenager is suing a peer for sharing fake AI nudes.\n\nIn another recent case in Los Angeles, the Beverly Hills Police Department is investigating students who allegedly shared images that combined real student faces with AI-generated nude bodies. However, due to California's lack of explicit legal language concerning AI-generated images, it remains unclear whether this constitutes a crime."}

{"title": "AI Models Show Bias When Picking Random Numbers", "date": "2024-05-28T00:00:00", "text": "Artificial intelligence models continue to surprise us with both their capabilities and limitations. A recent experiment reveals that these systems pick numbers as if they were humans, which is often flawed.\n\nWhen asked to generate 100 random coin flips, people usually fail because human-predicted sequences lack the true randomness found in actual outcomes. Similarly, when it comes to choosing a number between 0 and 100, individuals tend to avoid extremes and round numbers while favoring numbers ending in digits like 7.\n\nEngineers at Gramener conducted an informal test by asking major language models to pick random numbers within the range of 0 to 100. The results showed a clear bias: each model had its own “favorite” number that appeared frequently, even when settings were adjusted to increase variability.\n\nFor instance, OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo tends to choose 47, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku prefers 42. Gemini opts for 72. The models also avoided low and high numbers in the range, showing a tendency toward mid-range digits. No consistent patterns emerged across the board.\n\nSo why do these AI systems exhibit such biases? It’s not because they have consciousness or understand randomness. Rather, their responses mimic human behavior based on what was prevalent in their training data. They lack genuine reasoning and comprehension of numbers; instead, they repeat patterns found during their learning phase.\n\nThis phenomenon demonstrates the extent to which large language models (LLMs) mirror human tendencies, even when that’s not intended. In every interaction with these systems, it's crucial to remember that their responses stem from imitating humans rather than thinking independently. This pseudo-human behavior highlights both the strengths and limitations of AI models."}

This device draws inspiration from Jason Allemann’s Bricasso, but it uses artificial intelligence to simplify the process significantly. Eight years ago, the Bricasso required manual design and printing steps followed by scanning each mosaic piece. However, the new Pixelbot 3000 streamlines this workflow with a single text input. Users can specify any artwork they desire, which is then sent through OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 to generate an image in cartoon style. The AI-generated picture measures 1024 x 1024 pixels and must be adapted for the printer's smaller grid of 32 x 32 Lego tiles. To achieve this, the system divides the full image into a 32 x 32 square grid and samples each pixel’s center color. This process produces high-contrast imagery that enhances the final mosaic quality. Additionally, since only around 70 Lego colors are available and just 15 are used in the printer, the system performs one last operation to find the closest matching shade for assembly."}

Swift's significant influence in American pop culture makes her endorsement noteworthy, as it could encourage many people to register and vote through the power of sharing information online.\n\nSwift used this moment to express concerns about artificial intelligence (AI) deepfakes. She mentioned that false AI-generated endorsements of Donald Trump had been posted on his site, which heightened her fears regarding the spread of misinformation. To combat such issues, Swift emphasized the importance of transparency and truth in political communications.\n\nProfessor Linda Bloss-Baum from American University noted that Swift's personal experience with deepfakes adds a unique perspective to discussions about election integrity. Celebrities like Taylor Swift are particularly susceptible to AI-generated impersonations due to extensive online presence.\n\nNoah Downs, an IP and entertainment lawyer, warned of the increasing prevalence of fake endorsements by AI impersonators, even leading to public service announcements from shows like “Shark Tank.” Swift has previously been targeted with nonconsensual AI-generated content, sparking debates about legislative action against such harmful practices.\n\nProfessor Bloss-Baum explained that celebrity involvement in these discussions often garners more attention on Capitol Hill. However, she pointed out the limited legal frameworks currently available to address deepfake issues effectively. As election day approaches, there is little federal legislation to prevent misinformation spread via social media.\n\nBloss-Baum highlighted the need for comprehensive federal laws like the NO FAKES Act, which aims to regulate AI-generated content. Though this proposed act shows promise, it might not be enacted before the upcoming election in November.\n\nDespite potential risks from AI misuse, Bloss-Baum acknowledged positive applications of technology in campaign data collection and analytics.

{"title": "EU AI Act Advances with Committee Support", "date": "2024-02-13T00:00:00", "text": "The European Parliament's civil liberties (LIBE) and internal market (IMCO) committees have overwhelmingly approved draft legislation for regulating artificial intelligence. The vote this morning was 71-8, with seven abstentions, in favor of the compromise reached during lengthy 'trilogue' talks between EU member states last year. Originally proposed by the Commission in April 2021, the EU AI Act establishes a risk-based framework for AI applications. It includes prohibitions on certain uses like social scoring and sets rules for high-risk uses such as those in education, healthcare, and employment. General-purpose AIs and deepfake tools must adhere to transparency requirements under this act. Most AI apps are classified as 'low risk,' falling outside the scope of regulation. The plan also outlines regulatory sandboxes at national levels for developers to test risky applications in controlled environments.\n\nWhen first introduced three years ago, the EU's proposal did not generate much attention. However, the rise of generative AI over the past year has increased global interest and sparked divisions among lawmakers. MEPs sought to amend the proposal to cover powerful general-purpose AIs, while some member states, led by France, pushed for regulatory exemptions to foster national champions in advanced AI.\n\nDecember's marathon trilogue talks produced a compromise text that included provisions for general-purpose AIs but still faced opposition from certain governments. However, with recent critical votes passed, the bill is expected to be adopted within months. The draft law needs approval through plenary voting and final Council endorsement before it can take effect.\n\nToday's strong backing by both committees signals likely support in upcoming parliamentary votes. MEPs will need an absolute majority for adoption and entry into force later this year. Provisions banning prohibited practices would apply six months after implementation, likely in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe EU plans a phased rollout with legal requirements increasing over time between 2024 and 2027. The law will provide nine months for a code of practice to take effect; twelve months for rules on general-purpose AI including governance, and fully applicable within twenty-four months after entry into force. However, high-risk systems have longer application timelines.\n\nWhile the plenary vote seems likely to pass, some opposition remains. For instance, Pirate Party MEP Marcel Kolaja criticized the national governments' role in weakening the AI Act and stated that the law legitimizes real-time facial surveillance, leading Europe toward a dystopian future of mistrustful high-tech surveillance."}

One such example is Numa, which shifted its focus from conversational AI to customer service automation for auto dealerships and recently raised $32 million in Series B funding.\n\nTasso Roumeliotis, CEO of Numa, explains that the decision to concentrate on automotive-specific solutions stemmed from identifying a large market opportunity. Founded by Roumeliotis along with Andy Ruff, Joel Grossman, and Steven Ginn in 2017, the company has a history of successful ventures; previously, they launched Location Labs, which was acquired for $220 million.\n\nThe automotive industry, comprising over 17,000 new-car dealerships worth $1.2 trillion, often struggles with customer service inefficiencies. According to Roumeliotis, Numa addresses this issue by automating tasks such as call handling and appointment booking through AI technology. For instance, the platform can send follow-up texts or make reminder calls for missed calls.\n\nOther vendors offer similar solutions but lack a deep understanding of dealership workflows, whereas Numa's approach centers on user-centric design. Roumeliotis claims that the company’s proprietary models, trained using data from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), dealerships, and customer interactions, give them an edge in this market.\n\nPrivacy concerns about data usage are raised but not addressed directly by Roumeliotis. Despite this, Numa has managed to secure 600 clients across the U.S. and Canada. The company is reportedly close to achieving cash-flow break-even and intends to use its latest funding round to expand its engineering team for further product development.\n\nThe investment in Numa was led by Touring Capital and Mitsui, with additional participation from Costanoa Ventures, Threshold Ventures, and Google’s Gradient Fund.

Initially intended for release in June with Copilot Plus PCs, the company spent months improving its security architecture to make it an opt-in option that users can uninstall entirely if they choose.\n\nDavid Weston, vice president of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, expressed excitement about the enhanced security measures implemented for Recall. One major change is that users are no longer required to use the feature; instead, it’s now optional with a fully removable installation.\n\nSecurity researchers previously found issues such as lack of encryption in the database storing snapshots every few seconds. To address these concerns, Microsoft has encrypted all sensitive data related to Recall and uses Windows Hello for authentication against malware tampering. The encryption is bound to the TPM required by Windows 11, making it inaccessible without proper authentication.\n\nMicrosoft also moved all sensitive processes into a virtualization-based security enclave, isolating the app layer from raw screenshots or databases, with access limited only through Windows Hello authentication. This prevents unauthorized background access and ensures secure data processing.\n\nAdditional changes include blocking apps and custom lists of websites from being included in snapshots, as well as enhanced content filtering to exclude sensitive information like passwords, credit cards, health, and financial details. Users can also delete specific time ranges or entire app/website records from the database.\n\nMicrosoft has conducted extensive design reviews and penetration testing with its internal MORSE team and a third-party security vendor to ensure Recall’s robustness.

{"title": "New AI Feature Faces Security Flaws", "date": "2024-06-03T00:00:00", "text": "A new AI-powered feature called Recall is set to debut on Copilot Plus PCs on June 18th. Designed to capture and organize everything a user sees or does, Recall uses local AI models to take screenshots of activities and store them for quick retrieval. Experts who have tested the feature are raising concerns about its potential security risks.\n\nKevin Beaumont, a cybersecurity expert with experience at Microsoft, has found that data stored by Recall is not adequately protected. The feature saves all user activity in an unencrypted SQLite database, making it vulnerable to malware attacks. Despite assurances from Microsoft that Recall will be secure and encrypted, Beaumont demonstrated through his own testing that the database can be easily accessed by unauthorized users.\n\nBeaumont warned that hackers could exploit this vulnerability to steal sensitive information effortlessly. He shared details of how the database is stored locally on a PC's AppData folder, highlighting how easy it would be for an attacker to extract data from there. Furthermore, he created a website where people can upload their Recall databases and search through them instantly.\n\nMicrosoft plans to enable Recall by default on Copilot Plus PCs without giving users the option to disable it during setup unless they explicitly choose otherwise in settings. This has drawn criticism from privacy advocates who view this as an opt-out experience that may undermine user privacy.\n\nWhile Microsoft claims Recall includes privacy controls and does not capture certain types of sensitive content like passwords or financial information, Beaumont argues that these measures are insufficient to protect against malware attacks. The company also acknowledges that the snapshots remain on local devices but fails to address how they can be safeguarded from such threats effectively.\n\nThese issues come at a time when Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has emphasized the need for prioritizing security over new feature releases, even if it means delaying product launches. Given these concerns and potential risks, there are calls for Microsoft to reassess Recall's implementation or consider alternative approaches that better balance innovation with user privacy and security needs."}

The members of the AI Working Group, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Mike Rounds, Martin Heinrich, and Todd Young, developed this plan following several AI Insight Forums that featured industry leaders like OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman and Google’s Sundar Pichai alongside academics and advocacy groups.\n\nThe 20-page report does not present specific legislation but identifies key areas where Senate committees should focus their efforts. These include workforce training for AI, addressing AI-generated content in sectors such as child sexual abuse material and election information, protecting private data and copyrighted materials from AI systems, and reducing energy costs associated with AI.\n\nSchumer emphasized that the document aims to guide committees in crafting regulations rather than creating a comprehensive law covering all aspects of AI. Despite this roadmap’s release, some lawmakers have already introduced their own proposals related to AI regulation. However, given the breadth of areas affected by AI and differing opinions on regulatory approaches, it remains unclear how quickly these initiatives will become laws, especially with an election year ahead.\n\nThe working group advocates for collaboration between other legislators and the Senate Appropriations Committee to secure funding as recommended by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) to support research and development of AI and semiconductors across various government agencies and NIST testing infrastructure.\n\nUnlike some proposed bills that mandate safety evaluations before releasing new AI systems, this plan calls for establishing criteria under which such evaluations would be necessary. The roadmap also refrains from immediately revising existing copyright laws but leaves open the possibility of future adjustments to enhance transparency, content origins, likeness protections, and copyright issues.\n\nWhile Adobe’s general counsel Dana Rao praised the proposal as a positive start in addressing concerns within the creative industry, others criticized the high costs associated with implementing these regulations. For instance, AI Now's Amba Kak expressed doubt about the enforceability of the proposed measures and highlighted potential risks from excessive spending that could strengthen major tech companies’ dominance over AI infrastructure.\n\nCivil rights organizations like Color of Change’s Rashad Robinson were also critical, asserting that Schumer’s approach lacks seriousness towards addressing harmful biases in AI technology and failing to adequately protect Black communities against manipulative practices facilitated by unchecked technological advancements."}

Even when these challenges are addressed, a key obstacle remains: how robots handle errors without human intervention. This issue is more critical for consumers who lack the resources to fix problems themselves compared to industrial settings where companies can allocate dedicated personnel.\n\nA recent study from MIT offers a promising solution by integrating large language models (LLMs) into robotics systems to improve error recovery. The research, set to be presented at an upcoming conference, aims to incorporate more 'common sense' when correcting mistakes.\n\nTraditionally, robots follow pre-programmed instructions until they encounter errors that require human assistance. This approach is especially problematic in unpredictable home environments where minor changes can disrupt a robot's functionality. One solution has been imitation learning, but this method often fails to adapt to the numerous small variations encountered daily.\n\nThe new study tackles this by breaking down tasks into smaller subtasks and using LLMs to automatically identify these steps without manual labeling from programmers. This allows robots to recognize their current task stage and recover independently when errors occur.\n\nTo illustrate, researchers trained a robot to scoop marbles and pour them into a bowl. They then deliberately disrupted the process by bumping the robot or knocking marbles out of its scoop. Instead of restarting the entire task from scratch, the robot was able to self-correct small mistakes thanks to LLMs.\n\nThe researchers conclude that this method could significantly enhance home robots' autonomy and reduce dependence on human intervention for error correction."}

{"title": "Human Touch Shines at AI Film Festival", "date": "2024-05-11T00:00:00", "text": "In a discussion about generative AI's impact on art, multimedia artist Claire Hentschker fears that AI might commoditize creativity, leading to homogenized and derivative works. This concern was echoed during the second annual AI Film Festival hosted by Runway, where top 10 finalists showcased films integrating various forms of artificial intelligence such as synthetic backgrounds, animations, and special effects.\n\nThe festival took place in two cities: Los Angeles and New York, with the latter held at Metrograph. Despite advancements, AI-generated elements were still distinguishable from human-made components, often detracting from otherwise strong narratives due to their lackluster quality or inconsistencies. For instance, 'Dear Mom' by Johans Saldana Guadalupe and Katie Luo featured compelling storytelling but was marred by AI-generated anomalies in a freeway scene.\n\nThe limitations of current AI technology were evident as they constrained filmmakers in various ways. Simple tasks such as choosing consistent colors for characters required extensive workarounds, sometimes resulting in disjointed films that struggled to maintain coherence. A prime example was 'L’éveil à la création' by Carlo De Togni and Elena Sparacino, which utilized a series of disconnected vignettes linked only loosely through narration.\n\nIn contrast, films like 'Where Do Grandmas Go When They Get Lost?' by Léo Cannone succeeded despite their reliance on AI-generated components due to the emotional depth conveyed through human performances. The festival's grand prize winner, 'Get Me Out,' highlighted this trend with its powerful narrative about a Japanese man coping with immigration trauma in America. Although the film utilized AI for some visual effects, it was the cinematography and acting that truly resonated with viewers.\n\nWhile generative AI has potential to revolutionize filmmaking, current limitations indicate that human creativity remains indispensable. The festival underscored how essential the human touch is in creating compelling and emotionally impactful stories."}

These companies join others like Google and OpenAI in asserting that their models excel based on certain metrics. However, these claims often rely on benchmarks that may not accurately reflect real-world usage or user needs.\n\nJesse Dodge from the Allen Institute for AI argues that current evaluation methods are inadequate due to their narrow focus and age. Many existing benchmarks assess specific skills like fact-checking in limited contexts, which do not match how most people interact with AI chatbots. For instance, GPQA includes advanced science questions despite chatbot users typically needing assistance with everyday tasks.\n\nDavid Widder of Cornell University highlights that as generative AI evolves towards broader applications, older benchmarks become less relevant. Benchmarks testing skills such as basic math and grammar might not be pertinent to the average user. Moreover, some tests are flawed in design; HellaSwag has been found to contain numerous errors, while MMLU relies heavily on memorization rather than understanding.\n\nTo address these issues, Dodge proposes a hybrid approach combining traditional benchmarks with human evaluations. This involves assessing model responses based on real-world queries and having humans rate the effectiveness of those answers. Widder is less optimistic about fixing existing benchmarks but suggests focusing instead on evaluating the practical impacts and desirability of AI models in specific contexts."}

{"title": "AI's Spelling Flaws Exposed", "date": "2024-03-21T00:00:00", "text": "Despite AI advancements, such as acing the SAT and outplaying chess grandmasters, spelling remains an Achilles' heel. For instance, image generators like DALL-E can produce a Mexican restaurant menu but might include items spelled as \"taao,\" \"burto,\" and \"enchida.\" Similarly, when prompted to create a 10-letter word without 'A' or 'E,' ChatGPT offers the humorous suggestion of \"balaclava.\" Even attempting to generate a simple text sticker on Instagram leads to nonsensical results.\n\nAsmelash Teka Hadgu from Lesan and Matthew Guzdial explain that image generators use diffusion models, which reconstruct images based on patterns observed during training. These models excel at recognizing cars and faces but struggle with smaller details like fingers or handwriting. In text generation, large language models (LLMs) employ complex mathematical algorithms rather than actual reading comprehension, leading to spelling errors despite seemingly fluent outputs.\n\nWhile engineers can enhance datasets to improve image accuracy, addressing the intricacies of spelling in multiple languages poses greater challenges. Some systems avoid generating text altogether but may still produce nonsensical results given detailed prompts. For example, a recent Reddit video shows ChatGPT's struggles with ASCII art creation, highlighting its fundamental misunderstanding of letters and words.\n\nThese limitations are not just amusing but also useful for identifying misinformation in AI-generated content. Misplaced keys on pianos or extra strings on guitars can signal synthetic origins. While AI progress is undeniable, the hype surrounding these technologies often overlooks persistent shortcomings."}

Set to roll out later this summer, it enables users to search their photo collection using natural language queries that tap into the AI’s understanding of the photos' content and metadata. Previously, searches were limited to specific people, places, or items, but with Ask Photos, finding particular images becomes more intuitive thanks to advanced AI capabilities. For example, instead of searching for a “Eiffel Tower” photo, users can now ask for the best photo from each national park they visited during their travels. The AI evaluates various factors such as lighting and clarity to determine what constitutes the “best” photos in a set. It also uses geolocation data to identify images taken at specific locations like U.S. National Parks. This feature builds on Google Photos' existing Photo Stacks, which groups similar photos and highlights the best ones using AI technology. With over 6 billion photos uploaded daily, this new functionality aims to make searching more efficient as digital collections grow in size. Ask Photos also supports a variety of questions that require deeper understanding of photo content beyond basic keyword searches. For instance, parents can ask about themes used for their child's past birthday parties or track the child’s progress in swimming through photos and videos. Additionally, users can capture important information like license plates or passport numbers and later retrieve it via AI-powered search queries. If a user corrects an incorrect response from Ask Photos, the system will learn from this feedback to improve its accuracy over time. When sharing photos, the feature can generate captions that summarize their content, though this is still in basic form without style options. Google emphasizes that personal data used for Ask Photos won’t be utilized for advertising purposes or shared with other AI products like Gemini, and human intervention will only occur rarely if necessary to prevent abuse or harm. Initially launching in English in the U.S., the feature plans to expand globally and eventually integrate more deeply with Gemini on Android devices."}

{"title": "Current Unlearning Techniques Undermine AI Model Performance", "date": "2024-07-29T00:00:00", "text": "Techniques designed to make generative AI models forget undesirable data from their training are becoming more common. However, these methods can significantly reduce a model's ability to perform basic tasks, as shown in a recent study involving researchers from several institutions including the University of Washington and Google. The study evaluated eight unlearning algorithms using a benchmark called MUSE, which aims to assess how well models can forget specific data without losing their overall utility.\n\nModels like GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 are trained on vast amounts of public data from websites and datasets, but this process often includes copyrighted material or sensitive information that needs to be removed. Copyright holders frequently sue AI developers, leading to a need for better unlearning methods.\n\nThe MUSE benchmark tests how well models can forget specific books such as Harry Potter and related news articles without retaining any knowledge about them. The results show that while these algorithms can make models forget certain data, they also degrade the models' performance on unrelated tasks.\n\nAccording to one of the researchers, Weijia Shi, there are currently no effective methods for unlearning specific data without significant loss in model utility. This means that current unlearning techniques may not be ready for real-world deployment. The challenge lies in separating knowledge about copyrighted material from freely available content, as both are often intertwined within the model's training.\n\nAs a result of these limitations, developers will need to explore other approaches until more effective solutions are found."}

This has raised concerns among policymakers and stakeholders due to the ease with which GenAI tools can be misused for disinformation.\n\nIn response to these issues, Google, which recently downsized significantly, is increasing its focus on AI safety. The company’s DeepMind division, responsible for developing Gemini and other recent GenAI projects, has established a new organization called AI Safety and Alignment.\n\nThe new unit will consist of existing teams working on AI safety and additional specialized groups of researchers and engineers. One of the key initiatives within this organization is a team dedicated to ensuring safety around artificial general intelligence (AGI). This aligns with OpenAI's Superalignment division, which was formed last July.\n\nThe AI Safety and Alignment unit will work on incorporating safeguards into Google’s GenAI models to prevent harmful outcomes such as bad medical advice, child safety issues, and the amplification of bias and injustices. Anca Dragan, a former research scientist at Waymo and professor at UC Berkeley, will lead this initiative.\n\nDragan emphasizes that her role involves enabling AI models to better understand human preferences and values, be transparent about their limitations, and mitigate adversarial attacks. She asserts that addressing immediate concerns and long-term risks are not mutually exclusive.\n\nPublic sentiment towards GenAI tools is increasingly skeptical. A recent YouGov poll revealed that 85% of Americans are concerned about the spread of misleading deepfakes. Additionally, a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that nearly 60% of adults anticipate an increase in false information during the 2024 U.S. election due to AI tools.\n\nEnterprises also harbor reservations about GenAI’s limitations and implications. A Cnvrg.io survey indicated that around a quarter of companies piloting or deploying GenAI apps have concerns regarding compliance, privacy, reliability, implementation costs, and technical skill requirements. Another poll from Riskonnect found that over half of executives worry about employees relying on inaccurate information generated by AI tools.\n\nRecognizing the challenges in achieving perfect AI safety, DeepMind aims to invest more resources in this area and develop a framework for evaluating GenAI model safety risk soon. Dragan acknowledges that while significant progress can be made, absolute certainty is unattainable due to residual human cognitive biases and uncertainties.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether stakeholders will accept these efforts as sufficient given the potential risks involved."}

The designation, valid for five years, permits the authority to closely monitor how Microsoft uses its market power in the realm of generative AI. Despite this, no immediate decisions on restrictions have been made.\n\nIn recent times, Microsoft's deep ties with OpenAI have attracted antitrust scrutiny from regulators worldwide. During a board conflict last year, Microsoft briefly employed key staff members, including OpenAI's Sam Altman. While Altman remained at OpenAI, the episode highlighted the close relationship between the two companies and resulted in Microsoft acquiring an observer seat on OpenAI's board, which it later relinquished.\n\nThe FCO investigated Microsoft and OpenAI's partnership and concluded that their arrangement did not necessitate a traditional merger review last November. However, with new powers to regulate Big Tech more proactively, Microsoft’s activities involving OpenAI may face increased scrutiny in Germany moving forward.\n\nAndreas Mundt, president of the FCO, noted in his statement: “Microsoft's market dominance is stronger than ever due to its extensive use of cloud computing and AI. The company has solidified its position through developing proprietary products and forming cooperative agreements.”\n\nThe FCO initiated an inquiry into whether Microsoft warranted this enhanced scrutiny back in March 2023. Upon confirming that the tech giant holds significant importance for competition across multiple markets, it now possesses broader powers to regulate Microsoft's activities, including those related to AI, if deemed necessary.\n\nGermany’s current antitrust law already applies to Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta. Unlike the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which only regulates designated platforms and their services like Windows and LinkedIn for Microsoft, Germany's FCO has broader authority over the entire company. This allows it greater flexibility to address anti-competitive practices that fall outside the scope of the DMA.\n\nThe decision underscores the German regulator's ability to prevent competition-restricting behaviors not covered by EU regulations. In response to inquiries about the designation, a Microsoft spokesperson emphasized the company’s commitment to fostering a healthy competitive environment and its dedication to collaborating constructively with the FCO."}

The exact number of robots involved has not been disclosed by either party, suggesting it may be a relatively small initial rollout compared to deployments involving thousands or tens of thousands of units, which would typically warrant more public fanfare.\n\nGXO Logistics began testing Digit last year and recently signed another pilot agreement with competitor Apptronik. The impact these concurrent trials will have on each other remains uncertain.\n\nInstead of outright purchases, GXO is leasing the robots through a RaaS (robots-as-a-service) model. This approach enables clients to avoid large upfront costs while still gaining access to ongoing support and software updates from Agility Robotics.\n\nPeggy Johnson, who recently took over as CEO at Agility, emphasizes the company’s focus on delivering concrete returns on investment. She notes that this new deployment represents a major milestone for the humanoid robotics market by generating real revenue and addressing practical business challenges.\n\nAgility has consistently led its competitors in both technological development and actual implementation of robotic solutions, making it no surprise to see them achieve another significant industry first. Nonetheless, the field is still young and there is no clear leader established yet.\n\nEarlier last year, Amazon had also started a pilot program with Agility’s systems within their warehouses but has not announced any definitive plans regarding future collaboration."}

{"title": "Scammer Fined $6 Million for Using AI to Imitate Biden", "date": "2024-05-23T00:00:00", "text": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed a $6 million fine against a scammer who used artificial intelligence technology to mimic President Joe Biden's voice in illegal robocalls during a primary election in New Hampshire. The calls falsely advised voters not to participate, and though the focus is on preventing robocalls rather than AI ethics, the FCC sees this as an alert for potential high-tech fraudsters.\n\nIn January, numerous voters received messages supposedly from Biden discouraging them from casting their votes. These calls were fraudulent, utilizing voice-cloning technology that has become increasingly accessible over recent years due to advancements in generative AI platforms. Such services allow for the creation of cloned voices with minimal effort and regulation.\n\nThe FCC and various law enforcement agencies have clearly stated that using fake voices to interfere with elections or commit fraud is strictly prohibited. Loyaan Egal, Chief of the FCC's Enforcement Bureau, commented: “We will take swift action against anyone who misuses generative AI technology on telecommunications networks for fraudulent activities.”\n\nThe primary culprit behind this scheme was political consultant Steve Kramer, who collaborated with the dubious Life Corporation and utilized shady telecom services from Lingo (also known by various aliases). Kramer appears to be in violation of multiple FCC rules but faces no criminal charges yet due to limitations within the agency's jurisdiction.\n\nAlthough the $6 million fine is seen as a deterrent rather than an actual payment amount, it still represents a substantial penalty. Kramer will soon have to respond to these allegations, while separate legal actions are being pursued against Lingo and other associated entities.\n\nAI-generated voices were officially classified as illegal for use in robocalls in February following the aforementioned incident. The FCC's decision to categorize them as artificial was deemed appropriate."}
{"title": "OpenAI Closes Doors on Observer Seats Post Microsoft Departure", "date": "2024-07-10T00:00:00", "text": "Several months after Microsoft acquired an observer position on OpenAI's board, the tech giant has now relinquished this non-voting seat. In a recent communication to OpenAI, Microsoft expressed satisfaction with the company’s advancements and affirmed its trust in OpenAI’s future trajectory.\n\nOpenAI has declared that following Microsoft’s decision, no further observers will be permitted on their board. This move potentially dismisses reports suggesting Apple was aiming for an observer role. OpenAI conveyed gratitude towards Microsoft's ongoing support through a statement shared with a tech outlet.\n\nAs CFO Sarah Friar steers the course, OpenAI is now setting up new methods to engage with strategic partners and investors. Microsoft’s involvement in the observer capacity was initiated last year after Sam Altman's reinstatement at OpenAI following his dismissal, along with major changes within the board composition.\n\nThe current OpenAI board comprises Bret Taylor (former Salesforce co-CEO), Larry Summers (former Treasury Secretary), Fidji Simo (Instacart CEO), Nicole Seligman (ex-Sony executive), Sue Desmond-Hellmann (former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation leader), Paul Nakasone (former NSA director), and Sam Altman, excluding Adam D’Angelo.\n\nSince last year's restructuring, key researchers like Andrej Karpathy and Ilya Sutskever have left the organization. After his exit, Sutskever launched Safe Superintelligence Inc., focusing on enhancing AI safety measures.\n\nAlthough Microsoft has exited its observer status, it retains a 49% stake in OpenAI following an investment of nearly $13 billion. Such partnerships could provoke scrutiny from EU antitrust authorities as highlighted by Reuters earlier this year.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, the European Union’s executive vice president for competition policy, cautioned against such investments becoming conduits for Big Tech companies to exert control over other entities during a recent speech.\n\nAlex Haffner, an expert on competition law at Fladgate in the U.K., opined that Microsoft's decision might be driven by concerns related to regulatory scrutiny. In his view, the tech giant is being cautious to avoid attracting more antitrust investigations into its extensive investments."}

{"title": "Microsoft Defends AI Practices Against Copyright Claims", "date": "2024-03-05T00:00:00", "text": "A major publication filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, alleging that it copied its articles and used this data to mimic their style. In response, Microsoft's legal team asserts that large language models (LLMs) are similar to technologies like VCRs in terms of copyright law compliance. According to the motion, these systems have been deemed legal even if they pose potential risks for copyright infringement. Ian Crosby, a lawyer representing the publication, stated that Microsoft admitted working with OpenAI to copy articles but likened LLMs to VCRs despite VCR manufacturers never claiming necessity for massive infringement to build their products.\n\nMicrosoft further argued against the claim of induced copyright infringement by users of Copilot powered by GPT. The company maintained there was no evidence presented showing direct infringement by a user, thereby invalidating the Times' contributory infringement argument. Microsoft pointed out that similar lawsuits involving generative AI have failed due to this lack of concrete proof.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft disputes the assertion that it violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by removing copyright information from training data. The company cited previous cases where claims based on the same reasoning were dismissed."}

{"title": "Voice Researchers Find OpenAI's 'Sky' Resembles Scarlett Johansson", "date": "2024-06-01T00:00:00", "text": "Researchers from Arizona State University discovered that the voice of Scarlett Johansson closely matches “Sky,” a discontinued AI voice developed by OpenAI. NPR commissioned this comparison, which involved analyzing Sky’s voice against approximately 600 other actresses using advanced vocal similarity models. The study revealed that Johansson’s voice was more similar to Sky than 98% of the tested actresses. However, the analysis also indicated that Anne Hathaway and Keri Russell's voices were sometimes even closer matches with Sky compared to Johansson's.\n\nVisar Berisha, who led this research, commented on NPR that while there are clear similarities between Johansson’s voice and Sky, they are not identical. According to the findings, if Sky had a vocal tract, it would be similar in length to Johansson's. Nevertheless, Sky's voice was noted as being slightly higher-pitched and more expressive than hers, whereas Johansson’s is described as “slightly more breathy.”\n\nBerisha explained that due to the complexity of AI models used in this analysis, it is challenging to pinpoint exactly what vocal traits they identify as similar or different. The research team has developed other tools such as OriginStory (PDF), a microphone that can watermark voice recordings and prove their human origin.\n\nOpenAI did not respond immediately when asked for comment on the findings. Both OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, and CTO, Mira Murati, have previously denied that Sky was designed to mimic Johansson's voice. Following an earlier GPT-4o demo, it was reported that Altman had tried to get Johansson to lend her voice to the model, but she declined.\n\nWhile Johansson has not taken legal action against OpenAI yet and has only hired a lawyer for consultation, experts suggest that if she were to sue, there is a significant likelihood of success due to the difficulty in proving intentional mimicry."}
