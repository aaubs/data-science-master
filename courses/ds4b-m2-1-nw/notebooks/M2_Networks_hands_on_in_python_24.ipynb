The central plot follows **Jean Valjean**, a former convict who is struggling to escape his past and lead an honest life after serving 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread. Throughout the novel, Valjean is relentlessly pursued by **Javert**, a determined and morally rigid police inspector.\n",
