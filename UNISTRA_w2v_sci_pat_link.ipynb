Consequently, coherence depends in a lawful manner on power and phase-locking in the sender and connectivity. Changes in oscillatory power explained prominent changes in fronto-parietal and LGN-V1 coherence across behavioral conditions. Optogenetic experiments and excitatory-inhibitory network simulations identified afferent synaptic inputs rather than spiking entrainment as the principal determinant of coherence.

Here, we develop a learning rule from dendritic cable theory and use it to investigate the processing capacity of a detailed pyramidal neuron model. We show that computations using spatial or temporal features of synaptic input patterns can be learned, and even synergistically combined, to solve a canonical nonlinear feature-binding problem. The voltage dependence of the learning rule drives coactive synapses to engage dendritic nonlinearities, whereas spike-timing dependence shapes the time course of subthreshold potentials.

During brain development we discovered disrupted gene expression, mediated in part by loss of Myt1l gene-target activation, and identified precocious neuronal differentiation as the mechanism for microcephaly. In contrast, in adults we discovered that mutation results in failure of transcriptional and chromatin maturation, echoed in disruptions in baseline physiological properties of neurons. Myt1l haploinsufficiency also results in behavioral anomalies, including hyperactivity, muscle weakness, and social alterations, with more severe phenotypes in males.

The model captures an inverted U-shaped dependence of working memory on dopamine and spatial patterns of persistent activity observed in over 90 experimental studies. Moreover, we show that dopamine is crucial for filtering out irrelevant stimuli by enhancing inhibition from dendrite-targeting interneurons. Our model revealed that an activity-silent memory trace can be realized by facilitation of inter-areal connections and that adjusting cortical dopamine induces a switch from this internal memory state to distributed persistent activity.

Genetic loss-of-function experiments determine that the small GTPase RhoA relays extracellular inhibitory signals to the cytoskeleton by adapting mechanisms set in place during neuronal polarization. In response to extracellular inhibitors, neuronal RhoA restricts axon regeneration by activating myosin II to compact actin and, thereby, restrain microtubule protrusion. However, astrocytic RhoA restricts injury-induced astrogliosis through myosin II independent of microtubules by activating Yes-activated protein (YAP) signaling. Cell-type-specific deletion in spinal-cord-injured mice shows that neuronal RhoA activation prevents axon regeneration, whereas astrocytic RhoA is beneficial for regenerating axons. These data demonstrate how extracellular inhibitors regulate axon regeneration, shed light on the capacity of reactive astrocytes to be growth inhibitory after CNS injury, and reveal cell-specific RhoA targeting as a promising therapeutic avenue. \\u00a9 2021 The Author(s)\", \"year\": 2021, \"cluster\": 13}, {\"x\": 5.726093769073486, \"y\": 11.808769226074219, \"Title\": \"Shubha Tole\", \"doctype\": \"Article\", \"abstract\": \"Shubha Tole, Dean of Graduate Studies at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, India, shares with Neuron her approach to mentorship during these challenging times, how connecting diverse perspectives across the globe makes us stronger, and her love of the arts-including classical dance and poetry.

Rocchi, Oya and colleagues visualize site-specific brain connectivity in monkeys and human neurosurgery patients. They discover a common neural organizational principle that bridges gaps between primates as neurobiological models and human patients. \\u00a9 2021 The Author(s)\", \"year\": 2021, \"cluster\": 16}, {\"x\": 2.4673099517822266, \"y\": 5.750818729400635, \"Title\": \"Distinct roles of dorsal and ventral subthalamic neurons in action selection and cancellation\", \"doctype\": \"Article\", \"abstract\": \"Mosher et al. show that neurons in human dorsal STN participate in movement, while those in ventral STN respond to stop-signals.

Recent evidence suggests that STN can also cancel an already selected action when goals change, a key aspect of cognitive control. However, there is little neurophysiological evidence for dissociation between selecting and cancelling actions in the human STN. We recorded single neurons in the STN of humans performing a stop-signal task. Movement-related neurons suppressed their activity during successful stopping, whereas stop-signal neurons activated at low-latencies near the stop-signal reaction time. In contrast, STN and motor-cortical beta-bursting occurred only later in the stopping process. Task-related neuronal properties varied by recording location from dorsolateral movement to ventromedial stop-signal tuning. Therefore, action selection and cancellation coexist in STN but are anatomically segregated. These results show that human ventromedial STN neurons carry fast stop-related signals suitable for implementing cognitive control. \\u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.\", \"year\": 2021, \"cluster\": 3}, {\"x\": -2.4307281970977783, \"y\": 8.77512264251709, \"Title\": \"Lowering Synaptogyrin-3 expression rescues Tau-induced memory defects and synaptic loss in the presence of microglial activation\", \"doctype\": \"Article\", \"abstract\": \"Tau is a major driver of neurodegeneration and is implicated in over 20 diseases. Tauopathies are characterized by synaptic loss and neuroinflammation, but it is unclear if these pathological events are causally linked. Tau binds to Synaptogyrin-3 on synaptic vesicles. Here, we interfered with this function to determine the role of pathogenic Tau at pre-synaptic terminals. We show that heterozygous knockout of synaptogyrin-3 is benign in mice but strongly rescues mutant Tau-induced defects in long-term synaptic plasticity and working memory. It also significantly rescues the pre- and post-synaptic loss caused by mutant Tau. However, Tau-induced neuroinflammation remains clearly upregulated when we remove the expression of one allele of synaptogyrin-3. Hence neuroinflammation is not sufficient to cause synaptic loss, and these processes are separately induced in response to mutant Tau. In addition, the pre-synaptic defects caused by mutant Tau are enough to drive defects in cognitive tasks. Tau protein is implicated in multiple brain disorders (including Alzheimer's disease). In pathological conditions, Tau interacts with the synaptic vesicle-associated protein Synaptogyrin-3 at pre-synaptic terminals. In this report, Largo-Barrientos et al. show that lowering the expression of Synaptogyrin-3 prevents Tau-induced synaptic loss and cognitive decline, while neuroinflammation remains conspicuously upregulated. \\u00a9 2021 The Authors\", \"year\": 2021, \"cluster\": 11}, {\"x\": 0.03794342651963234, \"y\": 4.997406959533691, \"Title\": \"Top-down coordination of local cortical state during selective attention\", \"doctype\": \"Article\", \"abstract\": \"How do fluctuations in ongoing brain activity interact with cognitive functions?

We identified two circuits whose activity patterns predict the relative saliencies of competing visual objects. Stimuli presented to only one eye are selected by WTA computation in the inner retina. Binocularly presented stimuli, on the other hand, are processed by reciprocal, bilateral connections between the nucleus isthmi (NI) and the tectum.

Here we use fast, targeted, three-dimensional (3D) two-photon calcium imaging coupled with immunohistochemistry-based molecular identification to retrospectively map in vivo activity onto multiple classes of interneurons in the mouse hippocampal area CA1 during head-fixed exploration and goal-directed learning. We find examples of preferential subtype recruitment with quantitative differences in response properties and feature selectivity during key behavioral tasks and states. These results provide new insights into the collective organization of local inhibitory circuits supporting navigational and mnemonic functions of the hippocampus. \\u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.Geiller et al. use 3D AOD-based two-photon functional imaging and post hoc immunohistochemistry in mouse hippocampal region CA1 to simultaneously image and characterize the dynamics of hundreds of molecularly defined interneurons in vivo during spatial navigation, quiet wakefulness, and goal-oriented spatial learning. \\u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.\", \"year\": 2020, \"cluster\": 4}, {\"x\": -0.21588735282421112, \"y\": 4.965495586395264, \"Title\": \"Sub-second Dopamine and Serotonin Signaling in Human Striatum during Perceptual Decision-Making\", \"doctype\": \"Article\", \"abstract\": \"Recent animal research indicates that dopamine and serotonin, neuromodulators traditionally linked to appetitive and aversive processes, are also involved in sensory inference and decisions based on such inference.

First, an intensity-invariant representation of wind direction is computed by comparing left-right mechanosensory signals. Then, signals are reformatted to reduce the coding biases inherent in peripheral mechanics, and wind cues are brought into the same circular coordinate system that represents visual cues and self-motion signals. Because the compass incorporates both mechanosensory and visual cues, it should enable navigation under conditions where no single cue is consistently reliable. These results show how local sensory signals can be transformed into a global, multimodal, abstract representation of space. Okubo et al. show that wind influences the compass in the Drosophila brain.

However, loss of TBK1 function in motor neurons of the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS impairs autophagy, increases SOD1 aggregation, and accelerates early disease onset without affecting lifespan. By contrast, point mutations that decrease TBK1 kinase activity in all cells also accelerate disease onset but extend the lifespan of SOD1 mice. This difference correlates with the failure to activate high levels of expression of interferon-inducible genes in glia.

Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy of human neurons with this mutation showed that AIS plasticity is impaired by the abnormal accumulation of end-binding protein 3 (EB3) in the AIS submembrane region.

Mouse locomotor adaptation is specific to measures of interlimb coordination, has spatial and temporal components that adapt at different rates, and is context specific. The many similarities between human and mouse locomotor adaptation suggest that this form of locomotor learning is highly conserved across vertebrates. Using a variety of approaches, we demonstrate that split-belt adaptation in mice specifically depends on the intermediate cerebellum but is insensitive to large lesions of the cerebral cortex. Finally, cell-type-specific chemogenetics combined with quantitative behavioral analysis reveals that spatial and temporal components of locomotor adaptation are dissociable on the circuit level.

However, whether the effect of L. reuteri on social behavior is generalizable to other ASD models and its mechanism(s) of action remains unknown. Here, we found that treatment with L. reuteri selectively rescues social deficits in genetic, environmental, and idiopathic ASD models. Interestingly, the effects of L. reuteri on social behavior are not mediated by restoring the composition of the host's gut microbiome, which is altered in all of these ASD models. Instead, L. reuteri acts in a vagus nerve-dependent manner and rescues social interaction-induced synaptic plasticity in the ventral tegmental area of ASD mice, but not in oxytocin receptor-deficient mice. Collectively, treatment with L. reuteri emerges as promising non-invasive microbial-based avenue to combat ASD-related social dysfunction. \\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.\", \"year\": 2019, \"cluster\": 11}, {\"x\": 1.690372109413147, \"y\": 10.566625595092773, \"Title\": \"Migraine-Associated TRESK Mutations Increase Neuronal Excitability through Alternative Translation Initiation and Inhibition of TREK\", \"doctype\": \"Article\", \"abstract\": \"It is often unclear why some genetic mutations to a given gene contribute to neurological disorders and others do not.

We find that the rostral and caudal ends of the NAc shell are innervated by distinct but intermingled populations of forebrain neurons that exhibit divergent feeding-related activity. In the rostral NAc shell, a coordinated network-wide reduction in excitatory drive correlates with feeding, and reduced input from individual pathways is sufficient to promote it. Overall, the data suggest that pathway-specific input activity at a population level may vary more across the NAc than between pathways. Reed et al. report that opposing activity is present within each of the excitatory afferents to the nucleus accumbens during reward-seeking behavior. Synchronized reductions in excitatory input to the rostral nucleus accumbens shell correlate with and promote food consumption. \\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.\", \"year\": 2018, \"cluster\": 16}, {\"x\": 2.4704229831695557, \"y\": 10.681122779846191, \"Title\": \"Muskelin Coordinates PrPC Lysosome versus Exosome Targeting and Impacts Prion Disease Progression\", \"doctype\": \"Article\", \"abstract\": \"Cellular prion protein (PrPC) modulates cell adhesion and signaling in the brain.

Mice either deployed an active strategy\\u2014engaging their body toward the approaching texture\\u2014or passively awaited the touch. Independent of strategy, whisker-related posterior areas encoded choice early after touch. During the delay, in contrast, persistent cortical activity was located medio-frontally in active trials but in a lateral posterior area in passive trials. Perturbing these areas impaired performance for the associated strategy and also provoked strategy switches. Frontally maintained information related to future action, whereas activity in the posterior cortex reflected past stimulus identity. Thus, depending on behavioral strategy, cortical activity is routed differentially to hold information either frontally or posteriorly before converging to similar action. Gilad et al. measure neural activity from large parts of the neocortex while mice are performing a short-term memory task. They find that short-term memory is localized to a frontal or posterior part of the neocortex, depending on the mouse's behavioral strategy. \\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.\", \"year\": 2018, \"cluster\": 10}, {\"x\": 3.299997091293335, \"y\": 10.620163917541504, \"Title\": \"NonA and CPX Link the Circadian Clockwork to Locomotor Activity in Drosophila\", \"doctype\": \"Article\", \"abstract\": \"Drosophila NonA and its mammalian ortholog NONO are members of the Drosophila behavior and human splicing (DBHS) family.

This influence persists across an unexpectedly wide range of environmental light levels ranging from starlight to sunlight, which considerably expands the functional reach of melanopsin on visual processing. Moreover, melanopsin increases the excitability of M4 ipRGCs via closure of potassium leak channels, a previously unidentified target of the melanopsin phototransduction cascade. Strikingly, this mechanism is selective for image-forming circuits, as M1 ipRGCs (involved in non-image forming behaviors), exhibit a melanopsin-mediated decrease in excitability.

Specification of limb and thoracic V1 interneurons involves the Hox gene Hoxc9 independently of motor neurons. Thus, early Hox patterning of the spinal cord determines the identity of V1 interneurons and motor neurons. These studies reveal a developmental program of V1 interneuron diversity, providing insight into the organization of inhibitory interneurons associated with differential motor output. Sweeney et al. show that the diversity of spinal inhibitory interneurons, defined by combinatorial transcription factor expression, differs along the body axis in correspondence with limb and thoracic motor output.

Our results demonstrate that, unlike associative learning, which involves inputs from two sensory pathways, sensory pathway-specific plasticity in the Drosophila nociceptive circuit is in part established through feedback modulation. This study elucidates a novel mechanism that enables pathway-specific plasticity in sensory systems.

Mechanistically, peripheral nerve injury induces DNA demethylation and upregulation of multiple regeneration-associated genes in a Tet3- and thymine DNA glycosylase-dependent fashion in DRG neurons. In addition, Pten deletion-induced axon regeneration of retinal ganglion neurons in the adult CNS is attenuated upon Tet1 knockdown. Together, our study suggests an epigenetic barrier that can be removed by active DNA demethylation to permit axon regeneration in the adult mammalian nervous system. \\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.\", \"year\": 2017, \"cluster\": 11}, {\"x\": -1.3421483039855957, \"y\": 4.777608871459961, \"Title\": \"Chemogenetic Interrogation of a Brain-wide Fear Memory Network in Mice\", \"doctype\": \"Article\", \"abstract\": \"Behavior depends on coordinated activity across multiple brain regions.

Co-activation of the VC and AC suppresses VC-induced PTLp responses, leaving AC-induced responses. Furthermore, parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons in the PTLp mainly receive AC inputs, and muscimol inactivation of the PTLp or optogenetic inhibition of its PV+ neurons abolishes auditory dominance in the resolution of cross-modal sensory conflicts without affecting either sensory perception. Conversely, optogenetic activation of PV+ neurons in the PTLp enhances the auditory dominance.

Together, our findings reveal a key lncRNA epigenetic circuitry through interaction with chromatin-modifying complexes in control of CNS myelination and myelin repair. \\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.\", \"year\": 2017, \"cluster\": 11}, {\"x\": 1.538457989692688, \"y\": 5.473267555236816, \"Title\": \"Synaptic Correlates of Working Memory Capacity\", \"doctype\": \"Article\", \"abstract\": \"Psychological studies indicate that human ability to keep information in readily accessible working memory is limited to four items for most people.
